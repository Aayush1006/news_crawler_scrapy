"A senior adviser to Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has accused Australia’s prime minister,Scott Morrison, of destroying the chances of Middle East peace in order to win a byelection, after Morrison said he may recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.Nabil Shaath said on Tuesday that Palestinian officials were now lobbying Arab countries to reassess their trade and political ties with Canberra, hours after diplomats from 13 Middle Eastern and north African embassies in Australia held an emergency meeting on the issue.After Donald Trump’s move, Morrisonannounced on Tuesdaythat he was considering relocating the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising the latter city as the Israeli capital.Moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem a 'fatal mistake', Middle Eastern envoys warnRead moreWithin hours, the speech had also drawn ire from two of Australia’s key regional neighbours – Indonesia and Malaysia, both Muslim-majority countries. Jakarta expressed “strong concern”, while Malaysia’s “prime minister-in-waiting” Anwar IbrahimsaidAustralia could jeopardise its relations with Asian countries.Morrison’s Liberal party faces a potential byelection upset in what was previously considered a safe seat in the key Sydney electorate of Wentworth. If his party does not win, the coalition government will lose its one-seat majority in parliament.The Liberal candidate for Wentworth, Dave Sharma,deniedthat the Morrison’s announcement, which signals the reversal of a 70-year foreign policy stance by Australia, was connected to the byelection.However, the constituency is home to a sizeable Jewish population and Morrison credited Sharma – also a former ambassador toIsrael– for convincing him that the embassy move was a “sensible suggestion”.In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Shaath, a former foreign minister, said Morrison’s announcement was a hostile action that destroyed the chances of peace.“This doesn’t really help. It might increase the chances of the government winning Wentworth in Australia,” he said. “But if this is the way you do politics in the Middle East in order to win a byelection in Australia, then please allow me to be very negative towards the policy of that Australian government.“We’ll do our best that it will cause damage to Australia’s relations with the Arab world … This is a policy that brings nothing but ruin.”The status of Jerusalem has been one of the most sensitive issues in past Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. As well as the West Bank and Gaza, Israel captured the eastern side of the city in 1967 from Jordanian forces. It later annexed those neighbourhoods where thousands of Palestinians live, to global condemnation.International consensus has been that Jerusalem’s status should be settled in a peace deal and recognising it as a capital for either side would prejudice one party over the other. If Australia went ahead with the move, it would join just the US and Guatemala, which also relocated their embassy this year.A Christian evangelical, Morrison came to power in August on the back of a revolt by conservatives in his party. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has looked to evangelicals for support, many of whom see the Jerusalem being Israel’s capital as consistent with biblical prophecy of the second coming of Jesus and the rapture. However, Morrison denies his religion was a factor in his announcement.He and his foreign minister released ajoint statementamid the diplomatic fallout, saying that any decision on Jerusalem would be “subject to a rigorous assessment”. They added that Australia was committed to a two-state solutionand an embassy move would not block Palestinian claims over the eastern part of the city.Australia mulls Jerusalem embassy move: what happened and why it mattersRead moreSharma, they said, had suggested recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital “without prejudice to its final boundaries, while acknowledging East Jerusalem as the expected capital of a future Palestinian state. Specifically, the government will examine the merits of moving Australia’s embassy to west Jerusalem.”But Shaath disputed the rational, saying: “Claiming that considering Jerusalem the capital of the state of Israel and moving the Australian embassy to Jerusalem will contribute towards a regional peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians? What logic is this?”New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, also said the proposal would not help Middle East peace. “We support a two-state solution and our view has been that any shift in representation, in the way we saw with the United States, does not move us closer to that peaceful resolution,” she said.Morrison said the government would review the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama-era pact that Trump has withdrawn the US from and Netanyahu has been pressing other countries to ditch. The move would put Australia at odds with European signatories who still back an agreement that aims to curtail Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.TopicsPalestinian territoriesScott MorrisonMahmoud AbbasMiddle East and North AfricaIsraelDonald TrumpnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/palestine-accuses-australia-scott-morrison-jeopardising-middle-east-peace,Oliver Holmes,"

"One of the first acts of the Morrison government was to greenlight aprivate tourism development with helicopter accessin Tasmanian world heritage wilderness against the recommendation of an expert advisory body.The decision,signed by an environment department assistant secretaryon 31 August on behalf of the environment minister, Melissa Price, signalled the luxury camp on remoteHalls Islandin Lake Malbena was not a threat to matters of national environmental significance and did not need approval under federal laws.The plan – including a communal building, three accommodation huts, walkways and toilets – is strongly supported by the Tasmanian government. It is at the centre of a debate over the extent to which tourism developments should be allowed in the state’s national parks and theTasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which makes up about 20% of the island.Tasmanian election: on all sides, forestry is the issue that dare not speak its nameRead moreBut a leaked letter tabled in Tasmanian parliament by the state Greens leader, Cassy O’Connor, shows theNational Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council, a state body appointed to give independent advice to the state and federal governments on protected areas, did not support the camp going ahead.In advice dated 13 July, the council’s chairman, Malcolm Wells, raised concerns about allowing private commercial use of a world heritage area, a plan to erect permanent structures masquerading as standing camps, the impact of frequent helicopter flights and the potential for conflict with others using the area.The council said although the project was described as a small standing camp, in reality it would involve several buildings, putting it at odds with the area’s “self-reliant recreation” zoning. It challenged claims by the proponent,Wild Drake, that the site would be “rested” in winter to allow sensitive vegetation in the area to recover.“This appears to be a pretence at suggesting that the proposed buildings are a ‘standing camp’ that is not accessed all year. However, this is undermined by the next statement that up to five commercial trips (a total of 20 days) may run over this ‘resting’ period,” Wells wrote.The Wilderness Society Tasmanian campaign manager, Vica Bayley, said it was gobsmacking that Canberra would not fully assess a proposal in a world heritage area when a statutory body had recommended it not go ahead. He said national environment laws were transparently inadequate.“The evidence that the government has ignored its own experts makes a mockery of commitments to meet world heritage obligations,” Bayley said.Lawyersand activists are campaigning ahead of the next federal election for the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Actto be strengthened or replaced. Hundreds of Labor branches have passed a motion calling on the opposition leader, Bill Shorten,to commit to tougher laws if electedThe owner of Wild Drake, Daniel Hackett, said he stood behind about 200 pages of evidence submitted showing the Halls Island camp was a cultural and eco-tourism project that would not damage the environment. “The science speaks for itself,” he said.He said there would be no more than six tourists onsite at a time. They would mostly be bushwalking, kayaking and learning about the area’s cultural history. He said a helicopter was the way to reach the campsite with the least impact. A helipad would not be needed as it would land on an existing rock formation.A spokesman for Price said the project was a small tourism development and its approval was backed by Aboriginal HeritageTasmaniaand expert heritage advice. He said the department had considered all public submissions, including those by the advisory council, and Wild Drake had committed to strict environmental measures including capturing sewerage and grey water and using flight routes that avoided sensitive areas.Fast-tracked Tasmania resort plan raises fears over Chinese investmentRead moreThe Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, told parliament views on the camp varied, but it had been subject to a robust and extensive assessment process. He said it was proposed in 2015 after his government called for sustainable development proposals in wilderness areas.“When you objectively consider the lengthy processes this has been through at a state and commonwealth level in my view that should give Tasmanians confidence that this is one of those projects that will make Tasmania the ecotourism capital of the world that we should be,” the premier said.Hodgman said a world heritage area management plan released in 2016 allowing helicopters to land and take off had been approved by the commonwealth and the World Heritage Committee.But documents on the UNESCO website show the committeeraised concernsabout the government rezoning some areas from “wilderness” to “remote recreation” to allow tourism developments and increased aircraft access. Up to 30 tourism developments have been proposed in Tasmanian nature areas.Hackett said green groups had said from the time the camp was first proposed they would do everything they could to stop it. “I guess they’re coming through on that promise. I would say they are now engaging in bullying,” he said.The camp needs final approval under the local government planning scheme and from the Parks and Wildlife Service before it can go ahead. The latter has already given draft support.TopicsConservationTasmaniaAustralian politicsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/17/luxury-camp-allowed-in-tasmanian-world-heritage-area-despite-expert-advice,Adam Morton,"

"Donald Trumpfired a volley of insultsat Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday morning, 24 hours after shepublicly releasedthe results of a DNA test intended to prove her Native American ancestry.Referring to her by the racist moniker Pocahontas, Trump said: “She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024 [Native American,] far less than the average American …“Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public,”Trump continued.Sign up for the new US morning briefingHe was joined in criticism of Warren by the Cherokee Nation, who late on Monday released a statement about Warren’s disclosure. “Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong,” said the Cherokee Nation secretary of state, Chuck Hoskin Jr.Elizabeth Warren hits back at Trump's ‘Pocahontas’ jibe by releasing DNA testRead more“It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.”Trump gleefully incorporated the statement into his tweets at the Massachusetts senator, saying on Tuesday: “Now Cherokee Nation denies her, ‘DNA test is useless.’ Even they don’t want her. Phony!”Warren’s DNA analysis was performed by a Stanford University professor, Carlos Bustamante, a highly respected researcher in the field of genetics. His findings, released in a campaign video from Warren’s 2018 Senate campaign that concluded Warren’s ancestry is mostly European but said “the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor”, six to 10 generations back. Trump’s reference to “1/1024” referred to the scenario that her native ancestor is 10 generations back.The kerfuffle began during Warren’s 2012 Senate campaign when opponents accused her ofhaving advanced her academic careeras a law professor with the narrative that she is a descendant of Cherokee and Delaware tribes – using said claims to qualify for affirmative-action hiring considerations. In September 2017, a Globeinvestigationconcluded that she did not.Elizabeth Warren's DNA release proves it: she's running for presidentRead moreStill, Republicans generally, and Trump specifically, have seized on Warren’s claims of indigenous ancestry to paint her as a fraud and opportunist.Warren was, at a few points during her academic career, described as minority faculty – at least once by her own election campaign on a forum. Warren has previously said that she checked a box to list herself as a minority in professional listings at her university from 1986 to 1995 in order to connect with “people like me”.Warren has never claimed to be a member of a tribe, and made the distinction in her campaign video and again in a response to the Cherokee nation statement late on Monday. “I won’t sit quietly for [Trump’s] racism, so I took a test. But DNA & family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only – only – by Tribal Nations. I respect the distinction, & don’t list myself as Native in the Senate,”Warren said.The senator also attempted to goad Trump into making good on a promise he had made to donate $1m to her favourite charity, “paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian”. Warren asked him to cut a check tothe National Indigenous Women’s Resource CenterTrump said on Monday, while touring damage of Hurricane Michael in Florida, that the promise was contingent on her winning the 2020 Democratic primary and debating him during the campaign, and that he would only pay up if he couldtest her DNA “personally”.TopicsElizabeth WarrenDonald TrumpUS politicsNative AmericansnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/16/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-dna-test,Jamiles Lartey,"

"Far too little is being done to protect people from the heatwaves, storms and floods beingsupercharged by climate change, according to a high-level international commission. It aims to rebuild the political will to act that was damaged when US president, Donald Trump, rejected the global Paris agreement.TheGlobal Commission on Adaptationis being led by Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank. It involves 17 countries including China, India, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada and the UK.Much more money is being invested in cutting carbon emissions than preparing for the climate change impacts that are already inevitable. More than $380bn (£287bn) was spent on reducing CO2 in 2015-16, compared with just $20bn boosting protection from extreme weather.Former UN secretary general Ban said a step change in adaptation can and must be achieved: “Climate change is happening much, much faster than one may think. [But] where there is political will, anything can be done.”However, he said the international consensus to fight global warming had been damaged by Trump’s actions. On Sunday, Trump questioned whether global warming was caused by human activities, contradicting thelong-established conclusionsof the world’s scientists.'It'll change back': Trump says climate change not a hoax, but denies lasting impactRead more“We were very much united until December 2015 in Paris,” Ban told the Guardian. “Now unfortunately the level of solidarity is being loosened, especially by the Trump administration. Even though it is just one country, it has caused big political damage.”Adaptation measures to safeguard people’s homes, food, water and energy are being implemented in some places, but at far too small a scale, the commissioners said.“Continued economic growth and reductions in global poverty are possible despite these daunting challenges – but only if societies invest much more in adaptation,” said Ban. “The costs of adapting are less than the cost of doing business as usual and the benefits are many times larger.”“We are at a moment of high risk and great promise,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “If everyone does their part, we can reduce carbon emissions, increase access to affordable energy, and help farmers everywhere grow more productive crops.”“Our climate has already changed. Dramatic weather events and volatile seasons are the new normal,” said Georgieva. “We face a choice: business as usual and hope for the best. Or we act now and build for a resilient future.”The new group is comprised of 28 commissioners, including two national presidents, representing all regions of the globe and all sectors of development and industry. The US administration is not represented but Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, is a commissioner.The commission will produce a major report on adapting to climate change for the UN climate summit in September 2019, followed by a year of action to implement its recommendations.Fossil fuel dependence poses 'direct existential threat', warns UN chiefRead more“Scientists and economists believe the cost of adaptation could rise to $500bn per year by 2050 and, in the mid-term, $300bn by 2030,” said Ban. This money is available, he said: “I don’t think it is a matter of [getting the] money. The money can be mobilised.If there is political will, I think we can handle this matter.”In particular, the trillions of dollars held by investment managers and insurers should be put to work, Ban said: “We should not expect all this money to come from governments. The private sector has to be fully engaged.” He said 63% of the $380bn invested in cutting emissions in 2015-16 was from the private sector.TopicsClimate changeGreenhouse gas emissionsParis climate agreementBan Ki-moonBill GatesnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/16/leaders-move-past-trump-to-protect-world-from-climate-change,Damian Carrington,"

"Fred Chaney, the former deputy Liberal leader and Indigenous affairs minister in the Fraser government, has launched a scathing attack on the government’s controversial remote work for the dole scheme, calling it a “national disgrace” that is causing real suffering in remote Aboriginal communities.Chaney, who was also minister for social security, told Guardian Australia the Community Development Program (CDP) was a “scandalous failure of policy” based on “a denial of the facts”.Chaney’s comments came as the Senate voted on Tuesday to demand the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, release a long-withheld review of the CDP scheme.Remote work-for-the-dole changes to go ahead despite strong oppositionRead moreChaney would not comment on Scullion’s endorsement on Monday ofPauline Hanson’s “It’s OK to be white” motion,saying he was more concerned about the devastating impacts of the “punitive CDP”.Chaney said there was a “total carelessness shown for the hardship inflicted on remote Aboriginal people and the damage being done by this denial of the facts.“In my view, this policy is a national disgrace. It is a reversion to the attitudes of the past.“It’s another assimilationist, bureaucratic, irrelevant approach that will inflict more hardship, hunger and dysfunction on Aboriginal people.“It’s not community building, it’s the reverse. The more I see of it, the more I think we are reverting to the habits of the 1940s and 1950s.”There are about 35,000 CDP participants in Australia and 83% are Indigenous. As a condition of income support, remote area participantsmust engage in up to 25 hours of work for the dole, five days a week.Scullion has proposed changes to the legislation, which the Greens and Labor both say they will vote against.Under the changes, CDP participants would be subject to the same compliance measures as any other jobseekers “regardless of where they live or which government program they participate in”, Scullion has said.Last week, the changes were given the go-ahead by a Senate committee, despite every submission to its inquiry being opposed to the bill.“Aboriginal people in remoteNorthern Territoryface many barriers to complying with the type of work programs involved in the scheme,” the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency said. “These barriers include language considerations, lack of accessible Centrelink agents, excessive wait times on the phone, limited to no access to mobile reception and internet, high rates of illness and disability, and difficulties accessing even basic healthcare.Work for the dole an 'intergenerational time bomb' for Indigenous communitiesRead more“These barriers cannot be overstated. They are so significant that Naaja sees people remaining cut off from the Centrelink system after facing penalties. They are receiving no payments at all.“Food sales in communities are dropping. Penalised people cannot afford basic essentials.”Speaking about the Hanson motion, Scullion told the ABC on Tuesday he was “sorry for any suggestion that either I, my colleagues or the government supports any form of racism”.The motion was put to a second vote on Tuesday after the government said its initial support was the result of an “administrative error”.

It followed a sustained debate in the caucus where several MPs argued more expeditious transfers off the island was only the first step.Shorten has written to Morrison, urging him to take up Labor’s revised medical transfer procedures because they were about making sure “vulnerable and sick children in Australia’s care can receive the medical treatment they need – when and where they need it”.In the government party room, Liberal Trent Zimmerman raised the prospect of resettlement in New Zealand, and Morrison flagged reviving shelved legislationimposing a lifetime banon asylum seekers who arrive by boat from ever being allowed into Australia as a precursor to pursuing resettlement options.The prime minister pointed to the legislation – first introduced a year ago – on Monday in response to a question from the Victorian independent, Cathy McGowan, and again on Tuesday when he urged Labor and the Senate crossbenchers “to reconsider their opposition to the bill”.The government has signalled it is prepared to bring the shelved legislation on for urgent consideration in the Senate this week if the numbers are there to pass it.But Labor has rebuffed the overture if the legislation is represented in its current form. A spokesman for Shorten told Guardian Australia the opposition would not support the government’s proposal.Médecins Sans Frontières calls for immediate evacuation of all refugees on NauruRead moreThe Labor spokesman said if Morrison wanted to pursue a resettlement deal withNew Zealand, then he could pursue a bilateral agreement like the one Malcolm Turnbull struck with Barack Obama for refugee resettlement in the United States.Labor’s immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann said the government’s proposal would permanently exclude any person who travelled to Australia by means other than the normal channels for immigration, including by boat, from ever entering Australia.“The legislation is a ridiculous overreach and is irrelevant to securing third country resettlement arrangements and Labor does not agree to the legislation in its current form,” Neumann said.“Scott Morrison has not explained why these laws are required for a resettlement deal with New Zealand and the Liberals have not reached out to Labor to give an assurance of any such deal”.Shorten said in his letter to Morrison that Labor would support the government if they sought a bilateral negotiation with New Zealand dealing with refugee resettlement.As part of a flurry of activity inside parliament on Tuesday, with refugee advocates lobbying furiously in the countdown to the Wentworth contest, the four lower house crossbenchers – Cathy McGowan, Rebekha Sharkie, Andrew Wilkie and Adam Bandt – also met the immigration minister David Coleman in an effort to press the case that children needed to be removed from Nauru.New Zealand has made a longstanding offer to Australia to take 150 refugees from Nauru. On Tuesday the NZ minister of immigration, Iain Lees-Galloway, reiterated: “Our offer still stands.

"The surprise announcement by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Tuesday that Australia may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem appears to have divided Wentworth’s Jewish community, a forum on Tuesday night suggested.The forum featured four candidates running in Saturday’sbyelectionand was hosted by the Jewish Board of Deputies. There was applause for the Liberal candidate, Dave Sharma, as he explainedthe government’s new position, though others appeared to back the assessment by the independent Kerryn Phelps that the policy was nothing more than “a politically motivated move”.Palestinians accuse Australian PM of jeopardising Middle East peaceRead moreAustralia’s policies onIsraeland the Middle East, climate change and refugees dominated the forum.New internal Liberal polling,published in the Australianon Wednesday, suggested Phelps is in a winning position ahead of Saturday’s vote.Phelps is leading Sharma with 55% to 45% of the two-party preferred vote in theSydneyeastern suburbs electorate, according to the newspaper.At Tuesday’s forum, Sharma, a former ambassador to Israel, said it was “prudent to assess your foreign policy settings”.“The context for this is aUN votein which Australia will be asked to explain its position on voting down a Palestinian chairing a UN body,” he added.Phelps argued that the prime minister had proceeded without due process. “To announce it without bipartisan discussion, without comprehensive analysis of the defence, security and trade implications, this should not have been raised in the context of the byelection. There’s no question that this was a politically motivated decision,” she said to applause.Moving the Australian embassy to Jerusalem would be anti-Palestinian partisanship | George BrowningRead moreLabor’s Tim Murray, an economist and entrepreneur, faced questions over whether his party supported unilateral recognition of Palestine – a hot issue in the community.Murray said it was not the policy of the federal Labor party and he did not personally support it. He said resolutions passed at theNew South Wales, South Australian and Queensland state Labor conferences supporting recognition of Palestine did not mean that unilateral recognition was policy and that he would personally be advocating within the party against it.Also high on the Jewish community’s list of concerns wasclimate change – as it is with most Wentworth voters.A ReachTel poll of 661 voters in Wentworth, conducted between last Thursday and Sunday for Greenpeace using automated telephone surveys, found 40.6% nominated climate change as their top issue in the byelection.This was ahead of schools and education (7.4%), health and hospitals (8.4%), immigration (15.3%) and the economy (19%).Sharma faced the most sustained questioning as a result of the Coalition dumping its ownnationalenergyguaranteelast month, which has left it struggling to explain how it will tackle emissions and meet Australia’s Paris commitments.The Neg, which attempted to address both emissions and energy prices, was jettisoned after a backbench rebellion among conservatives that cost the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull his job.“I accept the science of climate change.

But he said the opposition leader, Bill Shorten,had announced on Tuesdaythat any child on Nauru deemed by medical staff to have a medical problem would be brought to Australia under Labor. He also said Labor would accept New Zealand’s offer to resettle 150 refugees.About 12.5% of the electorate of Wentworth are Jewish, according to the 2016 Census, making it among the largest Jewish communities in Australia.TopicsWentworth byelectionAustralian politicsSydneyJudaismIsraelReligionnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/wentworth-divided-by-possible-move-of-australian-embassy-to-jerusalem,Anne Davies,"

"Neoliberalism has caused “misery and social polarisation” yet remains in vogue with the Coalition government, according to the economist Bernie Fraser.The former Treasury secretary and Reserve Bank governor has made the comments in a presentation circulated to participants of the Australia Institute’s revenue summit to be held in Canberra on Wednesday.Michael Keating, a former secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, will also use the summit to raise doubts about the Morrison government’s budget forecasts.Australia’s housing boom is not heading for a soft landing. How did we get here? | Greg JerichoRead moreIn the background notes for Fraser’s speech, seen by Guardian Australia, he says that Australia’s 27 consecutive years of economic growth is a “standout”, “Winx-like” performance.But the record deserves only “qualified applause” because “too many Australians remain unemployed, under-employed, underskilled, underpaid and lack job security”.Fraser warns that society has become “less fair, less compassionate and more divided” and “more devoid of trust in almost every field of human activity” in the past 20 years.“As a disinterested player in climate change negotiations and a miserable foreign aid donor, we have slipped well down the list of good global citizens.”Political ideologies appear to have contributed to inequality and disadvantage in Australia in that time, he argues.Fraser in large part blames “neoliberalism” and its influence on policymaking for the “disconnect between Australia’s impressive economic growth story and its failure on so many markers to show progress towards a better, fairer society”.“Favouring the market system ahead of the state system, and individual interests ahead of community interests, can lead to profoundly unfair social outcomes.More than three million Australians living in poverty, Acoss report revealsRead more“Those unable to afford access to decent standards of housing, healthcare, and other essential services have to settle for inferior arrangements, or go without.”Fraser says charitable organisations see the effects of “real poverty” that result in “misery, anxiety and loss of self-esteem of mothers unable to put food on the table for their kids, of old and young homeless people, and the victims of domestic violence and drug overdoses”.Fraser summarises the key thrusts of neoliberalism as “the pursuit of the lowest possible rates of income and most other taxes and the maximum restraint on government interventions and spending programs”.Evidence in Australia and overseas shows the influence of neoliberalism on fiscal policy “and the misery and social polarisation that has come with it”, he says.The global financial crisis “should have” marked a tipping point, when the “idealised view of financial markets being self-regulating” was shattered. While Australia “avoided the worst traumas of the GFC” with prompt fiscal and monetary policy responses, in Europe “taxes were increased and spending programs slashed”, resulting in a further five or six years of severe recession.Fraser says that all political ideologies – taken to extremes – can be divisive and cause damage, including an ideology “based on a state system”.But the former Reserve Bank governor focuses on neoliberalism because it “remains in vogue”. The Morrison government “continues to reaffirm its over-riding commitment to lower taxation, and to assert that this is the best way to increase investment, jobs and economic growth” -despite the lack of evidence to support the theoryAlthough Fraser recognises that politics never can or should be taken out of policymaking, he suggests the best course is to “hammer away” at flaws of particular approaches.For example, Fraser praises “the avoidance of costly tax cuts accruing to large corporations” as a positive development – referring tothe Turnbull government abandoning the big business componentof its $50bn 10-year company tax cut plan.He suggests the “quick done-deal” ofLabor signing up to the Coalition’s proposed accelerationof the cut to taxes on small and medium business was an example that “political interests are always lurking nearby”.In a separate presentation Keating – who headed PM&C from 1991 to 1996 – warns the government’s promise to cap expenditure while simultaneously cutting taxes and returning the budget to surplus is based on overly optimistic assumptions of growth in GDP, wages and productivity.Why are stock markets falling and how far will they go?Read moreAccording to Keating, the government must stop assuming there have been no structural changes in the relationship between unemployment and the rate of wage increases.He notes that predictions of a tightening labour market leading to higher wages are predicated on assumptions of growth averaging 3% or as much as 3.5%.He will also say a sustained return to past rates of economic growth will be impossible unless we can ensure a reasonably equitable distribution of income, involving a faster rate of wage increases, especially for the low-paid.TopicsAustralian economyAustralian politicsEconomicsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/17/neoliberalism-has-caused-misery-and-division-bernie-fraser-says,"Paul Karp,Gareth Hutchens","

One third concerned a failure of service providers to act to resolve phone or internet issues; one quarter concerned disputed fees or charges, and an eighth complained that they had no internet connection or dial tone at all.Jones said she was among those who had become dissatisfied with her internet speed in the past year after she downloaded an app which allowed her to check her service in real time.Grand theft data: NBN chief says gamers could face limits on heavy usageRead more“OccasionallyNetflixwould hang, but most of the time I was happy with the quality of the service,” she said. “But I downloaded an app and I can check the speed, and I will see that I have six megabits per second (Mbps) in downloads and occasionally only 1Mbps uploads, and I find I am much less happy.”The number of complaints decreased in the second half of the year despite an uptick in the number of residences connected to the NBN, which as of June 2018 passed the halfway mark of its rollout with more than 4m premises connected.“We are expecting to see complaints continue to fall,” Jones said.The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCA) said it welcomed the slowed rate of complaints but was frustrated that new regulatory measures to protect consumers had not been in place from the start of the rollout.New measures include retail telecommunications beingordered to refund tens of thousands of customers who were sold high-speed plans on the NBN in areas where that speed could not be deliveredand mandatory testing to ensure a line is active and at the correct speed before contractors move on.“It is pretty clear to us that the market on its own will not provide good customer service,” ACCA chief executive Teresa Corbin said.TopicsAustralia newsTelecommunications industryOptusVodafoneNetflixInternetShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/17/telco-complaints-rise-for-second-year-as-homes-switch-to-nbn,Calla Wahlquist,"

"t is three decades since white Australia threw an exclusive party for itself to celebrate a bicentenary of European invasion and settlement thattrampled on the sensibilitiesof this continent’s Indigenous people.While debate around the celebration of Australia Day (Invasion Day) on 26 January intensifies yearly amid momentum for inevitable change, the nation is still remiss when it comes to officially commemoratingthe many tens of thousands of Indigenous people killedin frontier wars intrinsic to European “settlement” and expansion.Massacres and protest: Australia Day's undeniable historyRead moreThirty years is an eye-blink when it comes to 60,000-plus of Indigenous continental custodianship and civilisation. But three decades is almost two-thirds of the average life expectancy of Indigenous men in some Australian communities, and a long, long time in a federation sullied by its ill treatment and oppression of Indigenous people, and contemporary political indifference to their rights and welfare.In Canberra, a capital city of monumental buildings and memorials to the rise of the Australian federation, to British colonialism and to participation in empirical wars, there is but one memorial to the Indigenous people killed in battle or murdered on the frontier. And 30 years after its creationThe Aboriginal Memorial in the foyer of the National Gallery of Australiais more important than ever in its service of national memory.That’s why the gallery recently had its own celebration of the memorial – an installation of 200 hollow log coffins created by different clans of Arnhem Land’s Yolngu – that was commissioned by curator, writer, artist and activistDjon Mundineas a counter to the 1988 bicentenary.FacebookTwitterPinterestDjon Mundine in front of The Aboriginal MemorialWhen visitors came to Canberra, where I lived for two decades, I’d often take them to see Mundine’s The Aboriginal Memorial. It is a vast, beautiful, evocative and intentionally haunting work that represents the clans (as symbolised by the burial poles, each distinguished by unique painterly patterns and symbols) who live along the Glyde River estuary that snakes its way from fresh- to saltwater where it meets the Arafura in Arnhem Land.It evokes questions from visitors and others who might be unaware of Australia’s brutal history of Indigenous dispossession and violence.The beauty of the memorial is at odds with the horror of the experiences and events it connotesWhile it is artistically embedded in specific locality it is nonetheless imbued with a broader continental symbolism as a memorial to all Indigenous people killed in wars with British red coats, militias, raiding parties and police on the colonial and post-federation frontier.As both an art work and a memorial it’s a profound aesthetic and political statement – a portal to a violent continental past and to a contemporary commonwealth of Australia that refuses to facilitate the called-for truth telling of history or give federal amplification to Indigenous voice.Bundjalung man Mundine reflected on The Aboriginal Memorial during asymposium at the NGAto mark its 30th anniversary.The Aboriginal memorial, he says, “came as a reaction” in the mid-1980s to the looming 1988 Australian bicentenary celebrations.“As the bicentenary approached I was aware that lots of Aboriginal artists – and non-Aboriginal artists – were boycotting the bicentenary. To say it (the bicentenary) wasn’t such a boon to Aboriginal people would be an understatement,” he said in a live-streamed conversation with gallery director Nick Mitzevich.Mundine says that at the time he was taken by “the general crassness of certain parts of Australian society who thought, ‘have a monstrous barbecue and a piss up ... to celebrate your culture’”.“I decided that that absence, boycotting things, would not be noticed internationally – they wouldn’t take any notice, wouldn’t notice there weren’t any Aboriginal people ... so I thought we’d have to have a presence but the presence had to be on our terms.”The Aboriginal Memorial is the manifestation of that commemorative/artistic presence. First shown at the Biennale of Sydney in 1988, the memorial stood in the harbour city months after many thousands of Indigenous people and their supporters protested against theAustralia Daycelebrations – including a tall ships re-enactment – on 26 January 1988.It was toured overseas, including to St Petersburg, where an estimated 500,000 people viewed it.It was, Mundine says, an “important statement to show the world”.“Overseas, people would think, ‘these are beautiful things – it’s like a fairytale thing, a beautiful forest we can all go through like Hansel and Gretel’. But in the end they read the story and understand what it really was. It made enormous inroads in showing what really happened in the colonial wars here, and the fact that you keep it in the front here of the gallery is just amazing”.The beauty of the memorial is at odds with the horror of the experiences and events it connotes. Just as country, with its rivers and boulders, rainforests, sands and swamps, and its delicate ecosystems, harbours – and to an extent conceals – its bloody history.Mundine talked about his own country, the majestic northern rivers around Grafton, and the history of violence that belies its beauty.“I lived in Grafton. We are Bundjalung people. Our family have been very successful in our lives – we have famous sports men and women, we have famous actors and film makers and so on. But the whole of that landscape, which is a great alternative lifestyle place – it’s a beautiful green landscape of the northern rivers ... the whole of it is pockmarked with a whole series of massacres,” he says.""Wholesale massacre"": Carl Feilberg exposed the ugly truth of the Australian frontier | Paul DaleyRead moreThe Australian War Memorialin Canberraresolutely refuses to depict frontier warin its galleries. On Anzac Parade, the parade ground leading to the memorial, are monuments to the various Australian services and the many conflicts that they have been involved in.But there is no official monument there or anywhere else in Canberra to mark the Indigenous warriors who resisted European invasion and the theft of their lands.Meanwhile, the federal government is yet to publicly respond to the urgent need for anofficial keeping placefor the thousands of sets of Indigenous ancestral remains – many belonging to victims of frontier violence – that are kept in makeshift circumstances across Australia.Which lends added poignancy to The Aboriginal Memorial at the national gallery. And makes its conception, three decades ago, all the more prescient.And it begs an important question: 30 years hence will it remain the lone official memorial in Canberra, the place of national memory, to Aboriginal deaths in the frontier wars?Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia writer and columnistTopicsIndigenous AustraliansPostcolonialAustralia DaycommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/oct/16/a-presence-on-our-terms-the-aboriginal-memorial-is-art-work-and-political-statement,Paul Daley,"

"Ian Kiernan has died at the age of 78.The former builder and Sydney yachtsman became one of Australia’s most well-known environmentalists after he founded Clean Up Australia in 1989.He was diagnosed with cancer in July last year. Kiernan is survived by his wife Judy and two daughters Sally and Pip.In a statement, Clean Up Australia said Kiernan had “fought valiantly”.“While we will deeply miss Ian’s guidance and humour, it was his greatest wish that the work he inspired continues,” the statement read.“Ian believed that Clean Up belongs to the millions of volunteers who have taken to their streets, beaches, parks, bushland and waterways to remove the rubbish that is bothering them.“More recently this has extended to the thousands who take actions such as saying no to a plastic bag at the checkout, refusing a single-use item, or who join us via our social media campaigns.”Born on 4 October 1940, Kiernan grew up in Sydney and was educated at Scots College and the Armidale School in northern New South Wales.A keen sailor, after returning from an around-the-world trip Kiernan was struck by the amount of rubbish he had seen choking the world’s oceans.On his return he founded Clean Up Sydney Harbour in 1989. It eventually grew into the Clean Up Australia and Clean Up the World campaigns.“Ian Kiernan is recognised worldwide as the founder of Clean Up Australia, which began 30 years ago as Clean Up Sydney Harbour. In the following year his ‘simple idea’ went national before taking on the world in 1993 under the banner of Clean Up the World.

"I’m most looking forward to ...Giannis Antetokounmpoin Mike Budenholzer’s offense. Milwaukee’s new coach will install a system that complements everything the Greek Freak does well –which is practically everything– and mask his one flaw: perimeter shooting. If it works, Antetokounmpo’s surges up the court will resemble an alien attack rather than a basketball offense.OCWhat the Boston Celtics look like with the (fingers crossed)fully healthy Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. The Celtics were a game away from theNBAfinals last season despite missing their two best players. Now, the team’s young stars have impossible-to-overstate postseason experience, Irving and Hayward are coming back and have no LeBron James in their path. They could be something special.HFThe partnership between Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons blossom.Basketballis most pleasing as a sport of combinations, and inEmbiid and Simmonsthe 76ers have two players of contrasting styles, both on the brink of superstardom, who combine to devastating effect. Embiid has just enjoyed his first injury-free offseason, and if Simmons can discover that elusive jump shot, they will be terrifying to play against.ATWhat, if anything, stops the Warriors?The Warriors! More specifically:their chemistry. Something was funky about the team last year, and they looked, dare I say it, bored at times. Chucking DeMarcus Cousins on top of that could go one of two ways. Either they galvanize behind the big man, gel quickly, and blitz everyone before them. Or, they moan how tough it is to be great, gel slowly … and then blitz everyone before them anyway.OCLeBron's Lakers to competitive balance: NBA free agency winners and losersRead moreInjuries. Should they lose Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, there’s a chance that the Houston Rockets, LeBron James’s Los Angeles Lakers and maybe even the Boston Celtics – in the finals –couldstop them.HFInjuries, obviously – in particular to Curry, in whose absence at points last season the Warriors still managed to be good, but not as effective, somehow not quite asWarriorsy, as when Curry plays. Draymond Green is also showing signs of wear. The Warriors’ biggest enemy, though, won’t be any particular opponent butthe simple lethargy that comes with success. What I mean by all this is that nothing can stop them.ATThe most significant effect of LeBron’s move to the Lakers will be ...FacebookTwitterPinterestLeBron James’s departure from the Cavaliers opens the way for teams such as the Celtics in the East. Photograph: Tim Bradbury/Getty ImagesA new winner in the East. Duh. That is unless you count what LeBron is doing off the court:social justice, Hollywood, and everything in between. Talking strictly basketball, Boston, Toronto, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee now get to play for the honor of losing to the Warriors in the finals. Congrats, folks!OCThis may sound weird because he’s headed towards one of the biggest media markets in the world, buthe’s not going to be the center of the basketball world’s attentionanymore. In fact, that may be the appeal of the move for him. In Cleveland and Miami, James was the biggest celebrity in town, in LA he’s just another ridiculously famous person. Plus, his team are no longer prohibitive favorites to win the conference. It’ll be interesting to see how he performs under (somewhat) lowered expectations.HFThe boost to the off-court careers of the players he picks tostar alongside him in Space Jam 2.

Sorry, that’s two things.ATOne bold prediction …The Wizardstrade John WallorBradley Beal. Washingtonshouldbe among the top teams in the East. Only the Celtics, Raptors and Sixers have a better starting one-two punch than Beal and Wall. Still, the combo routinely flatters to deceive, and they haven’t been past the second-round of the playoffs in a weak East. If the Wizards are floundering at midseason, expect trade rumors to swirl around their top two guys.OCTheCleveland Cavaliers will make the postseason again, on the back of Kevin Love. We’ve forgotten how good a player Love was back when he was toiling with the Minnesota Timberwolves. While he’s older now, it wouldn’t be shocking to see him thrive in a role where he’s the main guy again. The top of the Eastern Conference is competitive, but there’s no reason to believe a lower playoff seed isn’t an achievable goal for these Cavs.HFThis season will signalthe beginning of the end of Russell Westbrook. The word “irrepressible” gets overused in sportswriting, but it might have been invented for Westbrook, who throws himself around the court with the vital, lashing energy of a tiger running down the hunt. But he will turn 30 in November, is coming back from the kind of knee surgerythat’s often a harbinger of irrevocable decline, and has never really recovered from the pain of losingthatWestern Conference finals series two years ago. A player who’s delighted and frustrated in equal measure is nearing the end of his time at the top.ATWhich rookie will impress the most?FacebookTwitterPinterestLuka Doncic in Dallas is the obvious choice, but let’s add some variety. Give meColin Sexton with the Cavs. In an awful East, someone is going to take the eighth seed. The Cavs have a cast of prideful vets and – as Hunter mentions above – Kevin Love. Sexton will add some sizzle to the dish: think of him as a mini-Russell Westbrook, a fire-breathing leaper with a limited offensive portfolio. Without LeBron, Sexton is going to getallthe touches he needs to improve his scoring game.OCHis name is Luka. Yes, I’m among the many who are all-in on Dallas Mavericks rookie Doncic,one of the most intriguing international playersthe league has seen in years. He’s also in the best spot, working alongside international legend Dirk Nowitzki while under the guidance of head coach Rick Carlisle.

"ark Walters cannot help smiling about the time Mo Johnston, his then teammate, received a bullet in the post. “I said: ‘Mo, you’ve taken the pressure right off me!” he recalls of the death threat sent to Johnston after the striker, a Catholic and former Celtic hero, joinedRangersin 1989. “We had a good laugh about it,” says Walters. “I had all sorts thrown at me – bananas, darts, a pig’s leg – and I had letters from the Ku Klux Klan telling me where I should go and what I should be doing with myself. But I never got a bullet! Unless you’ve been in a professionals’ dressing room, it’s hard to explain the humour.”Laughing off or blocking out hatred had been Walters’ modus operandi since long before he joined Rangers in 1987, when he became the only black player in the Scottish Premier League. He encountered abuse that may seem almost unbelievable today but says it was, in one respect only, easy to ignore because racism is boring and paying attention to it would not have helped him to fulfil his ambition of becoming a successful footballer. He achieved that, playing for his hometown clubAston Villabefore winning three Scottish titles with Rangers, a cap for England and the FA Cup with Liverpool.Paul Gascoigne hits back at Scottish FA over Hall of Fame snubRead moreWalters has rarely spoken publicly about much of this since retiring in 2002 but now, aged 54, he has released an autobiography, Wingin’ It, because he felt it was time to take stock. “It’s been cathartic,” he says of a book in which he addresses issues he had previously preferred not to discuss: racism, his frustration at the paucity of coaching opportunities for black former players and family matters including the lack of a relationship with his father, Lawrence Wabara, who played for Nigeria in the 1950s (“I only found out about that in my teens when I saw some pictures,” he says. “It did disappoint me, the fact he had been such a good footballer but never really did anything to help me”).As a child, reared by his Jamaican mother, Ivy Walters, the future winger used to sneak into Villa Park. He ended up making his Villa debut aged 17 a month before the club beat Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final. He was not in the squad for that match but later established himself as a key first-team player and one of the most exciting wingers in the country. Everton, then English champions, tried to buy him in 1987 but Walters chose Scotland.“People said Rangers must have blown them out of the water financially but there was very little difference in the money,” he says. “The main reason was that English clubs were still banned from European competition, whereas Rangers had the Champions League. Lots of good English players had already gone there, like Ray Wilkins and Terry Butcher, and I had already become a bit of a fan of the club after watching them play in Europe on TV and loving the atmosphere at Ibrox.”My upbringing was to work twice as hard to achieve something if you have to. Stick it out.The atmosphere on big European nights turned out to be everything he had hoped for, but to enjoy the good times he first had to overcome an altogether more violent reception. “[Graeme] Souness [Rangers manager] did tell me I might get some stick but I had no idea there were no other black players in the Scottish league and would have been shocked if told I was going to be a pioneer, but that certainly wouldn’t have put me off,” he says. In his first appearance, away to Celtic, a large number of the 50,000 crowd made monkey noises when he touched the ball and the match had to be stopped so bananas could be cleared off the pitch.The abuse was even worse from Hearts supporters two weeks later. This time Walters knew what to expect, partly because on the way to the game a teammate showed him a newspaper interview with a man displaying a huge batch of fruit he had bought to hurl at Walters. “The guy was standing there with his stall, very proud … so I was aware I had to be on my toes but I was shocked when the match started and I saw it wasn’t just fruit but people were also throwing darts and even a pig’s leg. That made me chuckle, but only when I got off the pitch at the end and knew I was safe.” Had he considered leaving the pitch before the end to avoid being hit? “My mentality was to play better and I can thank my mother for that,” he says. “My upbringing was to work twice as hard to achieve something if you have to. Stick it out.”FacebookTwitterPinterestMark Walters and Richard Gough celebrate Rangers’ Skol Cup final win against Celtic in 1990. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Getty ImagesThe treatment he endured provoked widespread condemnation across Scotland. After that racist abuse grew rarer. Walters even got a letter from a Hearts fan apologising for his behaviour and announcing he had imposed a lifetime stadium ban on himself. “I never had one problem in Scotland outside a stadium so I like to think [the abuse] was just an attempt to put me off my game rather than a sign that people were genuinely racist,” he says. “And that letter was good, if he really learned from it. Because education is always the answer.”Walters provided footballing education after retiring but not as much as he would have liked. He earned all of his coaching qualifications and began what he hoped would be a long second career by taking charge of an under-nines team for Villa. “I was prepared to start at the bottom and work my way up because I had never coached before,” he says. But the highest he climbed was to be head of Villa’s Under-14s, apart from a brief stint coaching the first team at the invitation of manager David O’Leary before the Irishman was sacked in 2006. Walters spent five years coaching in schools on behalf of the Football Association. “But I never really got a chance to manage young professionals, players at the level or near the level I had played who could really benefit from my advice,” he says. “In my opinion unless you’re a manager’s son or have been playing golf with the head of academies or something, you’ll never get a job. Jobs were going to guys who had never even played professionally.“I had all the badges and every award going – in fact, I was overqualified for every job I had. I applied for lots of others but most didn’t even bother replying. I realised it was about who you knew.Sign up for our daily football email The Fiver.“The nail on the head was when I was when Villa asked me to take the Under-10s … Fortunately I don’t need coaching to be able to live because I have properties and other things that keep me busy but I would love to have an opportunity to give back some of my knowledge. The only opportunities at the level I wanted would have been abroad. I had the chance to go to the US but I was going through a divorce at the time and didn’t want to continue that cycle of a father not being around for his children.”His son and daughter are now 23 and 25 respectively and he says his opportunity to coach at the highest level may have passed. But he believes measures must be introduced to ensure other black coaches can rise as high as their ability deserves: “The ratio of black coaches to black ex-players is ridiculously low and that can’t continue.”Wingin’ It: The Mark Walters Story (Pitch Publishing) by Mark Walters & Jeff Holmes is out.

"upita Tecual Porquillo had heard a rumour that the plaza was going to be “remodelled”. The 51-year-old grocery store owner lives around the corner from the centre of Santa Maria Tonantzintla, a sleepy town in the state of Puebla, about three hours fromMexicoCity. She assumed “remodelling” meant repairing the plaza’s centuries-old cobblestone pavement.In November 2017, heavy machinery arrived to tear out the characteristic cobblestones and replace them with smooth, uniform stone tiles. On 11January, Tecual Porquillo discovered the municipality had also knocked down the clock tower and stucco bridge – both beloved landmarks in the central plaza.Rumours spread among the residents of Tonantzintla. They heard that a gourmet market would open along the plaza, that ticket booths would appear outside the church to charge for entry, that a building would be demolished to make room for a parking lot for tourists. Some even said that religious processions – a crucial part of civic life – would no longer pass through the plaza.'Living laboratories': the Dutch cities amassing data on oblivious residentsRead moreA meeting for affected residents later revealed that Tonantzintlawas to become part of a pilot project: smart cities.Smart cities integrate technology into urban infrastructure, usually to improve sustainability, maximise efficiency and minimise energy usage. It’s a strategy generally undertaken in major metropolitan areas – like Singapore, Barcelona and Seoul – with specific technologies and strategies varying from place to place. In London, for instance, it involves the use of sensor networks to monitor traffic flow andallows citizens to report graffiti using an appLast year Puebla’s governor José Antonio Gali Fayad announceda statewideBarrio Smart(smart city) initiativein conjunction with the organisationAlianza Smart Latam. According to the initiative’s website, the project has “the objective of constructing spaces that benefit citizens through the implementation of technology”.FacebookTwitterPinterestResidents campaign to stop Tonantzintla from becoming a smart city. Photograph: Madeleine WattenbargerSmart city technology in Puebla is slated to include “safe crosswalks, free internet, video surveillance, seismic alarm, playground, trash cans, signage, ecological benches and payment modules”. In January, the city of Atlixco, about half an hour from Tonantzintla,became Latin America’s first smart city, complete with a new bike path, security cameras, speed sensors for cars and free internet access.But in being presented with this futuristic-sounding vision, it appears that residents of Santa Maria Tonantzintla found themselves caught in a conflict repeated the world over, between centuries-old customs and new development trends.We want a clinic, parks, things to entertain ourselves, so we don’t have to go all the way to Puebla [city]Lupita Tecual PorquilloWhile smart city planning has largely been undertaken in dense metropolises, some smaller cities have embraced its ideology. The Dutch city of Eindhovenhas become an emblematic example of a small smart city– it embraces urban experimentation with less than half a million residents. Key to smart city planning, though, is responding to local needs. Eindhoven’s smart city programme manager, Guus Sluijter, emphasised that theprogramme comes from the ground up. “Our citizens are key in addressing problems and central to solving them,” Sluijter toldSmart City Hub. “We see [smart cities] becoming a society for the people, by the people, in which citizens actively identify issues in their city.”In Tonantzintla the smart cities proposal became a lightning rod for those concerned about a development that seemed to favour outsiders rather than residents. “When politicians ask us what we want, we tell them we want a clinic, parks, things to entertain ourselves, so we don’t have to go all the way to Puebla [city] to go out,” Tecual Porquillo says.Residents like Tecual Porquillo don’t understand the true goal of the project, says architect Victor Campos, who was involved in the design on behalf of the municipality’s secretary of public works.“The purpose was to order the urban spaces so that they would function correctly,” he says. The tourist buses that pass through Tonantzintla for brief stints each day bring little economic benefit for the town as a whole – the tourists file into the church, file back onto the bus and leave. The plan, according to Campos, had to do with improving the streets to better regulate vehicle flow and expanding the plaza to allow for more space for local events.FacebookTwitterPinterestThe smart city plans in Tonantzintla were formed to benefit the community, architect Victor Camps says. Photograph: Madeleine Wattenbarger“This was all so that the community would benefit,” Campos says.Moreover,the municipality turned the publicity of the project over to local authorities who represent the interests of residents, he says. But Tecual Porquillo says the municipality organised a consultation meeting involving just 15 or 20 residents – not a representative sample.The failure of communication and understanding between the municipality, planners and locals cuts to the heart of conflicts around urban development: how can planners achieve local buy-in, and how can residents truly play a role in determining what happens to their cities?‘They’re ashamed of their roots’Like the vast majority of Latin American towns from the colonial era to the present, Tonantzintla’s centre – physically, civically and culturally – is a church set on a plaza. Tonantzintla’s church is particularly notable, attracting dozens of tourists each day. The interior is covered with elaborate gilded carvings, in a style that fuses the baroque decorations of the late 17th century with indigenous carvings.Tonantzintla’s residents take enormous pride in the church, and diligently raise money to preserve it. The town is deeply tied to its Catholic and indigenous traditions, so even superficial changes like the repaving of the old cobblestone roads signify a departure from culture and identity. The smart city proposal – which insinuated that the way things had been was now somehow inadequate – touched a nerve.This is our heritage. If you don’t like it, it’s because you don’t love your rootsMercedes Tecuapetla QuecholMercedes Tecuapetla Quechol, a local resident, attributes the changes to a sort of cultural racism. Mexicans call this phenomenonmalinchismo: a feeling that the foreign, particularly western, is always preferable to tradition. “They are ashamed of their roots,” Tecuapetla Quechol says. “They saw something they liked in the United States or in Europe, so they want to put it here.”Within weeks of the smart city’s construction, a group of residents brought complaints against the initiative. After discovering that the municipality hadn’t secured the necessary permits from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, they filed an injunction that put the project on hold and finally caused the municipality to cancel it.In Puebla, around15 more cities are slated to become smart cities. The Atlixco project (the only finished project so far) has also sparked an outcry – at the end of July, the bike lane was removed because it wasonly used about once every two weeks, according to residents. Some local business owners have also complained that theirsales have dropped significantly since the projectbeganInside Greece's first smart city: 'Now you don't need to know a politician to get something done'Read moreOn a Thursday afternoon in late June, Tonantzintla’s plaza is sparsely populated. People pass by on their way from school or work, and a few vendors mill around the edges selling ice cream, quesadillas, chocolate. At around two o’clock a tour bus pulls up, and a group of visitors file out of the doors, taking photos before entering the church. “This is what the city wants,” says anthropologist Julio Glockner, who haswritten a book on the iconography in the churchand supported the residents who oppose the smart city.Looking out at the plaza, Tecuapetla Quechol sighs. “It looks bald. I miss the bridge and the clock,” she says. “They think this is what tourists want.” After passing through the church and snapping photos of the plaza, the visitors return to the bus and drive away to continue on their circuit around Cholula.Later that afternoon a priest leads a procession of 10 or 15 people through the plaza. A woman scatters flower petals and together a few men support the shrine of a saint. Several musicians playing drums and brass instruments follow behind. “This is Tonantzintla,” Tecuapetla Quechol says. “This is our heritage. If you don’t like it, it’s because you don’t love your roots.”Follow Guardian Cities onTwitterFacebookandInstagramto join the discussion, andexplore our archive hereTopicsCitiesTech and the cityMexicoAmericasfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/16/the-mexican-town-that-refused-to-become-a-smart-city,,"

"oe Manchin is shouting in the middle of a job fair. It’s in an exhibition space at a community college in Parkersburg,West Virginia, an industrial town on the Ohio river. He is going booth to booth to booth, making conversation and taking selfies.Manchin has come to one table that provides office workers to companies on a provisional basis and is convinced that someone he just met is a perfect fit. He starts asking his staffers to find the young man who was looking for an accounting job and direct him over to the booth.The Democratic senator could have come out of a lab for politicians. The 71-year-old Manchin has salt and pepper hair and just the right amount of twang. He comes across as one of God’s natural retail politicians, treats every voter like a friend. Most return the adoration, although there are a few rolled eyes. High schoolers ask him to come to their football game and grown men excitedly pile next to him to pose for a photograph.However, less than 24 hours after Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate judiciary committee, he kept getting asked about Brett Kavanaugh – the conservative supreme court pick whom Manchin would eventually vote for.Sign up for the new US morning briefingWest Virginia was a traditionally Democratic state for generations. However, it has pivoted on a dime. A former bastion of blue-collar New DealDemocratsit has become a Republican stronghold based on issues like guns, abortion and the “war on coal”. Although West Virginia has long been economically populist, it is socially conservative and the coal industry occupies a key place in the state’s psyche.West Virginia is one of two races – alongside one in Tennessee – that are crucial to the Democrats’ chances of winning back the Senate in next month’s midterm elections. Democrats probably need to win in both West Virginiaand Tennesseeto have a chance of flipping the slim 51-49 Republican majority in the Senate. Democratic control of the upper chamber would mean that they could block not just legislation but Trump appointees to office, including the courts, as well.Manchin and Bredesen are both willing to embrace Trump at times and practice a Clintonian brand of politicsThus Democratic fortunes in the Senate rest on the unlikely shoulders of two septuagenarian white men in states that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly. These two older white men are a world away from the slate of diverse candidates that the Democrats are running across America for the House.Although much has been made of the so-called “blue wave” that Democrats are counting on in the midterms to win control of the House of Representatives, their task in taking back the Senate is a much stiffer challenge. And in the centre of that challenge are Manchin in West Virginia and Phil Bredesen inTennesseeThese two candidates differ markedly from the new slate of Democratic candidates who are rushing to embrace progressive causes like Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and flirt with the concept of abolishing Ice (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Manchin and Bredesen are from a different school of centrist Democrats. They are also both willing to embrace Trump at times and practice a Clintonian brand of politics where they look at both political parties in Washington and proclaim “a plague upon both your houses”.Both men supported the confirmation of Kavanaugh to the supreme court – the two most prominent Democrats to do so.FacebookTwitterPinterestSenator Joe Manchin, right, Democrat of West Virginia who is running for re-election voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court. Photograph: Mary Calvert/ReutersA clear sign of why Manchin eventually backed Kavanaugh was evident in Parkersburg where attendees were invariably coming up to Manchin to urge him to support the embattled nominee – while the West Virginia senator was staying perched precariously on the fence. To one woman, he simply laid out the recent history of judicial nomination fights on Capitol Hill. He said Democratic anger on the issue was rooted in the showdown over Merrick Garland thatRepublicans“wouldn’t even meet him and that’s what makes ’em mad”. Manchin went on to point to fault on “both sides” and insisted “we want to get everyone back together”.Speaking to the Guardian afterwards in a public park before a veterans event, Manchin pointed out “there’s still more Democrats than there are anything else in West Virginia. The bottom line is they got upset after it got to the point that the Washington Democrats forgot about the rural Democrats.” Manchin, who is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, instead tried to emphasize his independence. “I don’t care whether [you’re a Democrat or a Republican] … it’s about West Virginia first and that’s where I’ve always been.”His Republican opponent, Patrick Morrisey, is almost the antithesis of Manchin. While Manchin is a native West Virginian who grew up as the star high school quarterback, Morrisey is a New Jersey native who worked as staffer and lobbyist on Capitol Hill before moving to the Mountain State and beating a five-term incumbent to become the first Republican state attorney general since before the New Deal.FacebookTwitterPinterestDonald Trump shakes hands with Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, on 29 September. Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Republican regularly branded his opponent as “dishonest Washington liberal” and painted him as a pawn of the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer. Trump has appeared regularly with Morrisey and the West Virginia Republican could not name one area of disagreement with him.“I want to emphasize my areas of commonality with the president because the body of his work has been very impressive for the people of West Virginia,” insisted the Republican Senate candidate. “No one is an ideological twin of another person. President Trump has been a strong ally for West Virginia and we’re going to keep emphasizing that.”The message may not be cutting through in polls. Manchin has maintained a steady lead in West Virginia and has consistently been hitting Morrisey on his past as a pharmaceutical lobbyist, an important issue in a state that has been devastated by the opioid epidemic as well on the Republican’s opposition to Obamacare and the effect that would have on West Virginians with pre-existing conditions.However, while that message and approach may be working for Manchin in West Virginia, it may not be as successful in Tennessee.As a fellow centrist Democrat, or blue dog, Bredesen is running a similar race to Manchin. However, although his Republican opponent, Marsha Blackburn, is just as ardent a Trump fan as Morrisey, the state has surprisingly little in common with West Virginia save the Appalachian mountains and a blowout margin for Trump in 2016.Tennessee is divided into three parts by the swoop of the Tennessee river, which rises in the eastern part of the state, descends into Alabama before emerging to flow northward into the Ohio river in Paducah, Kentucky. The key battlefield is middle Tennessee, the central part of the state penned inside the river.If it’s, ‘Do you want to send Phil Bredesen or Marsha Blackburn to Washington?’ I think I can win thatDemocratic candidate Phil BredesenCentered around Nashville, the region is economically thriving. Nashville is a tourist hub that has attracted Fortune 500 companies and the population of the metro area has doubled since 1990. One of the key figures in this process was Bredesen. First as mayor of Nashville and then as Tennessee’s governor, the 74-year-old played a key role in reviving the city, attracting pro sports teams and reviving Tennessee’s once sleepy capital city.A wealthy former CEO of a healthcare company and transplant from the north, Bredesen long cut an almost disconcertingly moderate figure in the state.He has tried to run a campaign that avoids national politics as much as possible. Inone television ad, Bredesen looks squarely at the camera and says: “Look, I’m not running against Donald Trump.” Instead, he paints himself as a bipartisan problem solver and deflects any talk of the Democrats taking control of the Senate. “The chances of my party of being in the majority are minuscule,” he said in a debate.Instead of making it about party labels or national figures, Bredesen has tried to keep things local in a state that has been strongly Republican in recent decades. Inan interview with Politico, the former governor said if the race is about, “‘do you want to send a Democrat or Republican to Washington?’ I would lose. If it’s, ‘Do you want to send Phil Bredesen or Marsha Blackburn to Washington?’ I think I can win that.”In contrast, his opponent Marsha Blackburn, a 16-year-veteran of Capitol Hill, is fully embracing Trump. Blackburn, who usesthe masculine title ofcongressman, is a bomb thrower who long irritated many establishment Republicans in Tennessee dating back to her time in the state legislature.Blackburn, who has been a frequent cable television presence, is a fervent social conservative. She has been an implacable opponent of abortion and even co-sponsored legislation, prompted by conspiracy theories about then President Barack Obama, to force presidential candidates to disclose their birth certificates.During the campaign, she has consistently echoed Trump’s rhetoric. On television, she slams Bredesen for opposing the Trump travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and for his skepticism about the efficacy of a wall on the US-Mexico border.Blackburn’s hard-right policies even prompted an intervention by Taylor Swift, a Tennessee resident in the race. Swiftendorsed Bredesenin an Instagram post and cited the Republican’s record on gay rights and women’s issues in doing so.FacebookTwitterPinterestDonald Trump and the Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn during a campaign rally on 1 October in Johnson City, Tennessee. Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesHowever, demographic changes in the state and not its pop singers represent her key vulnerability. Her home base, the well-to-do Nashville suburb of Williamson, was one of only four in the state where Hillary Clinton did better than Barack Obama in the general election and was the sole holdout from Trump in the primary, when it went for Marco Rubio.Although Nashville suburbs are still solidly Republican, that is starting to change ever so modestly and in the long term are trending towards Democrats. This combined with Blackburn’s weak personal poll numbershas given Democrats hope.Scott Golden, the chair of the Tennessee Republican party told the Guardian, “there are no moderates left in Washington DC … it is a partisan team sport.” He cited the divisive vote over Kavanaugh.In recent weeks Tennessee voters have seen the race through the same lens. In the aftermath of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight, Blackburn has surged while before the showdown, Bredesenheld a narrow lead.For Republicans, the hope is these highly charged and highly partisan national issues can trump the brands carefully built by both Bredesen and Manchin over decades in public office. The two men both came out in support of Kavanaugh’s nomination, trying to thwart one potential line of attack and cool the partisan enthusiasm of the Trump voters whom they will be relying on in November. The result was that one major Democratic Super Pac, Priorities USA, announced that it would no longer be supporting the two Senate candidates in November. The decision is simply another indication that their politics as moderate, red state Democrats may increasingly be outliers in a party that is moving leftwards.Many liberal activists have argued that leftwing candidates in diverse states like Andrew Gillum in Florida or Beto O’Rourke in Texas are their party’s future. But for now, in a Senate map that is tilted towards red states, Democrats have no other options but to embrace throwbacks to a moderate past if they have any hopes of regaining the majority.TopicsUS midterms 2018West VirginiaTennesseeRepublicansDemocratsUS politicsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/16/democrats-chances-of-seizing-senate-rest-on-two-centrist-older-white-men,Ben Jacobs,"

"ust outside of Los Angeles in Ranchos Palos Verdes, theTerranea Resortboasts fine dining, a golf course, scenic beachfront views, and accommodations ranging from luxury guest rooms to private, secluded villas. While it may be a paradise for guests, resort workers claim they are subjected to a culture that has enabled sexual harassment and sexual assault.The Terranea Resort, which has hosted conferences attended by luminaries including Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, first came under scrutiny for harboring sexual harassers in summer 2017, when a former dishwasher and chef assistant, Sandra Pezqueda, filed a sexual harassment and assault lawsuit against the resort and the staffing agency that employed her to work there.In the lawsuit, Pezqueda claimed she experienced repeated sexual harassment and assault by her supervisor whoretaliatedagainst her rejections by changing her work schedule.“After you speak up, they try to look for reasons to complain about your work to make you feel bad about your work, when, before you reported, you were never scolded,” Pezqueda said. “Terranea claims to be there to help you when you report, but what happens to women is they make fun of you when you report or, what’s easier, they lay you off.”Pezqueda was honored as a silence breaker inTime Magazine’s Person of the Year2017 issue as part of the #MeToo movement for her courage to speak out. In May 2018, shereceiveda $250,000 settlement. Terranea Resort was cleared of any wrongdoing in the case.The latest complaints come asfast-food workersand other low-paid employees have gone public with their struggles and cities, states and politicians including Senator Bernie Sanders are considering action to protect workers from harassment.Bernie Sanders(@BernieSanders)We need to confront how women are treated in this country starting from the bottom on up. 66% of hotel workers and 40% of fast-food workers say they have experienced sexual harassment.https://t.co/WdBUi79fAhOctober 2, 2018Jasmin Sanchez filed a lawsuit against Terranea Resort in September 2018. The lawsuit accuses Stephen Harrington, the resort’s loss prevention manager who conducted Terranea’s internal investigation into Pezqueda’s complaints, of sexual harassment and assault.Included in the lawsuit is a text message Harrington sent to Sanchez in August 2016 after taking her cellphone number from a staff bulletin board. “My dick keeps getting hard thinking about it, I’m gona have to beat it off again in the ballroom restroom,” the text read after Harrington told her that he watched her on the security cameras as she worked. Sanchez reported the text messages to human resources, who she claims brushed them off. A few days later, Harrington cornered Sanchez in a room and sexually assaulted her for reporting him, according to the lawsuit.“When it happened, it gave me panic attacks. I wasn’t able to go back to work. I just left, I couldn’t stay and didn’t want to go back,” Sanchez said. Harrington also repeatedly threatened to have her car towed after she initially reported the text messages, she claimed. “I chose to speak out because my mom is a hotel housekeeper who has been sexually harassed and also because working women like me deserve respect.”Terranea declined to comment on Sanchez’s case, but noted Harrington resigned from his position at the resort in November 2016. “These are very serious allegations that do not reflect the values or culture of Terranea,” added a Terranea Resort spokesperson. “Since we opened our doors in 2009, Terranea Resort has remained true to our commitment to value the contributions of each associate, maintain positive workplace relationships and offer a rewarding professional experience.”The supervisor whom Pezqueda accused of sexual harassment and assault reportedly harassed and assaulted other co-workers as well. Monica Sanchez (no relation to Jasmin), a former dishwasher who worked with Pezqueda, explained that a few months into her employment at Terranea in 2014, her supervisor began sexually harassing her.FacebookTwitterPinterestTime magazine’s 2017 Person of the Year cover, The Silence Breakers, which featured women who have spoken out against harassment, and included Sandra Pezqueda. Photograph: Billy & Hells/AFP/Getty Images“He propositioned me to have sex with him. He said if I go with him, I’d get a better position at work,” Monica Sanchez said. She rejected his advances, but two months later they escalated and she says her supervisor grabbed her by the waist. “I asked him what are you doing? I said please respect me, and he laughed at me. After that, I complained to his manager who told me not to pay attention to it, that he was just joking, he wasn’t being serious about what he said.”Monica Sanchez no longer wanted to work at Terranea but said she had to keep the job out of necessity. She claims the supervisor switched her schedule from mornings to evenings in retaliation, and propositioned her again with the offer to change her schedule back. “It was like hell to work there,” Monica Sanchez added. “I experienced so much fear and humiliation at Terranea.”She eventually quit in early 2016, but the supervisor and a friend of his who also worked at Terranea continued to harass her through the next year in texts with sexual propositions and threats not to report. She had to change her cellphone number and Facebook profile as a result.At Terranea, supervisors and managers have not been the only perpetrators of sexual harassment and assault. In sworn affidavits, three former housekeepers claim their reports to management of guests sexually harassing them, which included exposing themselves, were ignored and often viewed as joke.“There are so many things that happen to you as a woman there, and management never listen, they never care. We are exposed to propositions, harassment, and requests from guests because we work isolated by ourselves,” said Rosa Marina Moreno Garcia, another former housekeeper, in an interview. She worked at the resort from 2009 until August 2017, when she was fired for allegedly taking breaks that were too long, the same excuse used to fire Pezqueda after she reported sexual harassment and assault from a supervisor. “I’ve had so many experiences with guests exposing themselves, completely naked.”McDonald's workers walk out in 10 US cities over 'sexual harassment epidemic'Read moreA Terranea Resort spokesperson denied the allegations; “We are unaware of any complaints involving our housekeepers like those you referenced,” they said. “We have a zero-tolerance policy toward unlawful harassment of any kind.”Garcia is one of the workers in favor of providing hotel housekeepers with panic buttons to provide protection from sexual harassment and assault while working in isolated areas of the resort.The Ranchos Palos Verdes city councilpushedback a ballot initiative to 2019 for a citywide ordinance to install panic buttons for hotel housekeepers. Terri Hack, the president of the Terranea Resort since it opened in 2009, personally complained to city council members about signature gathering for the ballot initiative and expressed concerns about union activity related to the initiative. In April 2018, attorneys for the Terranea Resort formally wrote to the Ranchos Palos Verdes city attorney that the initiative “must be rejected if and when initiative ‘proponents’ file the signed petition with the city clerk’s office”.Similar voter initiatives are on the November 2018 ballot in Long Beach and Oakland, California, where activists hope to join Chicago in enacting policies to protect hotel workers from sexual harassment. A Hands Off, Pants On ordinance waspassedby the Chicago city council in October 2017. An April 2016surveyconducted by Unite Here Local 1 union in Chicago found 58% of hotel housekeepers reported experiencing sexual harassment from guests, an issue that remains rampantthroughoutthe hotel industry.A statewidebillwas introduced in early 2018 by the California state representatives Wendy Carrillo, Bill Quirk and Al Muratsuchi, but was held up in the state senate appropriations committee where the bill is now essentially dead after getting passed in the state assembly in May 2018.“I was very disappointed,” said Muratsuchi, the leading author of the bill, in an email to the Guardian. “This bill proposed some commonsense protections from sexual assault and harassment, such as requiring panic buttons be given to housekeepers to summon assistance in an emergency situation. I want to make sure the Me Too movement leads to safer workplaces for all women, including hotel housekeepers, many who are working-class immigrants. I intend to reintroduce this bill and keep fighting next year.”FacebookTwitterPinterestA bill to protect hotel workers is stuck in California’s state capitol in Sacramento. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesDespite these legislative efforts and reports from several former employees, current Terranea employees claim hotel management still doesn’t take reports of sexual harassment seriously.Shortly after Sharon Merino began working as a barista at a cafe in the resort in April 2017, a maintenance worker in his 50s began harassing her whenever she ran into him on resort property.He found out she worked as a teaching assistant outside the resort, which prompted him to refer to her as his “beautiful teacher”, whenever he saw her, in addition to other inappropriate comments about her looks.“The comments were getting more intense. I didn’t want to run into this person and changing the subject wasn’t working,” Merino said. “He would catch up to me on the property asking why I was hiding from him. It got to the point where I didn’t want to leave my station at the coffee shop. I didn’t know what else would happen.”After an incidence where Diaz stared at her outside on the property while making vulgar comments about her, Merino told her manager and went to human resources in December 2017 to provide a formal statement.“After I gave my statement, they said ‘maybe you didn’t tell him firmly enough or he thought you were playing’, but I said ‘no, I did tell him firmly enough’,” Merino added. She was told he was not allowed to work in her area any more, but she started seeing him again after a couple of months. “My manager said not to tell my dad or brother, who also work at the hotel, because I wouldn’t want to get them involved and in trouble.”Her harasser still works as a supervisor in his department, and Merino continues to remain uncomfortable and in constant fear at work because of the harassment.Topics#MeToo movementHotelsUS unionsMcDonald'sFood & drink industryfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/hotel-workers-sexual-assault-harassment-terranea-resort,Michael Sainato,"

The Virgin Group foundertold the Australian website news.com.authat his cash is often rejected by the owners of his favourite restaurants around the world.“Obviously, if you’re in that lucky position where you can afford to pick up the bill, you should do it,” he said. “But one of the bizarre things about being successful and making money is the amount of times restaurants will say: ‘Oh, don’t worry, Richard, we don’t expect you to pay.’”In contrast, the X Factor has come under fire this week for allegedly faking footage of contestants flying first-class to Los Angeles.A video released by the airlineshowed the singing hopefuls sipping champagne and reclining in luxury seats – but when the cameras were switched off, they were reportedly sent back to economy.Given the publicity Aer Lingus got from this, you would be forgiven for thinking the airline could have let the contestants fly in first class. Still, at least they weren’t on a Virgin train, eh Richard? They would belucky to get a seatThese stories illustrate one of the great ironies of money: that people who have vast sums of cash are often given freebies, while those who can least afford it are left without. Let’s call it a reverse Robin Hood: where companies who would recoil at giving discounts to someone on a minimum wage fall over themselves to distribute expensive gifts to the already wealthy.The X Factor example seems particularly bad taste considering that this stage of the show is built on taking primarily working-class young people to gawp at mansions supposedly owned by Simon Cowell and the other judges. Filming them in first-class travel before unceremoniously dragging them from their seats takes “look at the life you could have” to a whole other level, and it’s a particularly crass demonstration of how power and wealth work. It is seemingly only once you don’t need the help that other privileged figures see you as someone they want to spend money on.This goes for positions of power – say, a rich, well-connected figure such as George Osborne being given, at last count, more than a dozen jobs, each with generous salaries, but someone who is struggling to pay the rent can barely get one. It seems like an extension of shopping in a store without price tags; when you have vast wealth, those around you seem keen to forget about that vulgar little thing called money.One of my favourite quirks of the Oscar ceremony isthe goodie bags that nominees receive, containing thousands of dollars worth of beauty products and more. It’s all a bit backwards, isn’t it? Multimillionaire Hollywood stars are perhaps the one group you could give a diamond-studded unicorn to and they would barely bat an eyelid. Give me a free hand cream and I’ll tell everyone I meet about it for a good 72 hours afterwards.Ethics aside, if companies were smart, they would ditch fawning over the wealthy and start handing out freebies to ordinary folk, who would appreciate it. Give a first-class plane ticket to a trainee teacher and you will get a grateful customer for life. Hand a box of makeup to a new mum and it will be on social media within two minutes. I await my gift baskets in the post.Being poor shouldn’t mean you are not allowed alcoholTalking of capitalism, it’s mid-October and like many of you, I’m planning for Christmas. Wait, wait! Give me a minute. As any good elf knows, Christmas doesn’t just arrive on the 25th – it comes with months of planning. Some delights are only possible with some autumnal forethought. Take high-end advent calendars. If you want to get your hands on a coveted beauty calendar – think pricey pots of face creams rather than lumps of chocolate – you will need to race to the high street now, or even get on a waiting list.At the other end of the inequality spectrum, many food banks are planning ahead for the Christmas season. There’s a scheme near me where you collect goods throughout November and pass on a full basket for someone who needs it to get through the holiday. It’s a great idea, but I paused at one rule: no alcohol.Perhaps there’s legal reasoning in place, but it all seems a bit Victorian, doesn’t it? It reminds me of those who criticise giving money to people sleeping rough with: “They’ll only spend it on booze!” It simultaneously assumes people in poverty are drunks and wasters, while assigning them a morality clause no one with money is expected to live by.It’s worth remembering that research by the Social Metric Commission recently showedthe middle classesconsume more drink and drugs than the poorest. Besides, who would begrudge someone a drink at Christmas, let alone when they are going through the sort of crisis that leads them to a food bank? Being able to offer a guest a glass of fizz and a mince pie is a way to feel human as much as anything. Whether it’s luxury calendars or a bottle of wine with family, we all deserve that.There’s no longer something about MaryOnce an Irish stalwart, the name Mary is now endangered in Ireland as parents switch to modern alternatives, according toa study by the genealogy company Ancestry. I grew up in an English-Irish household and family legend has it that I was set to be a Mary Frances, but got a last-minute reprieve when Mary was relegated to middle-name status. I have always been relieved about that, what with Mary making me sound like an octogenarian nun. Still, there’s something tragic about the eradication of my (almost) namesake. And there is nothing like scarcity to push up something’s value. Be proud, Marys! You’re Ireland’s rarest gems.TopicsMoneyOpinionShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/richard-branson-and-the-reverse-robin-hood-why-do-companies-lavish-gifts-on-the-rich,Frances Ryan,"

"“Was I brave or stupid?” Rosemary Kyburz has mostly bitter memories of 1980, the year she became the villain of anti-abortionists inQueensland. They filled her mailbox with vile messages, used sanitary pads and polaroid pictures of penises. Someone shot her dog.“They shot a rifle over my fence and got him in the back legs,” Kyburz, a former Liberal MP, told Guardian Australia. “He lived, I took him straight to the vet. There are some very fanatical people about abortion, they’re poisonous in that way. Righteous people will never change.”On Tuesday, laws will go before the Queensland parliament to repeal the 119-year-old section of the criminal code that makes abortion an offence. The state has debated the termination of pregnancy, again and again, for almost 50 years. For pro-choice campaigners, this week is the culmination of a long and often bitter fight.'You were shamed, punished': Queensland changes its mind on abortionRead moreThe first brickIn 1973, bricks started flying through the windows of the Women’s Centre at Red Hill in Brisbane, where the group Children by Choice was offering all-options counselling and referring women to abortion clinics in Sydney.“The attacks gave publicity to the work they were doing,” Beryl Holmes wrote in an account of the group’s formation. “Through these and other stories, Queensland women learned that they had a choice.”The first Brisbane clinic, at Greenslopes in the city’s south, started seeing women in the late 1970s. By the turn of the decade, the Bjelke-Petersen government was discussing ways to “end abortion on demand” and bolster the 1899 criminal code to shut the clinic down.In 1980, Kyburz leaked details of proposed new laws – to ban abortion in all circumstances except where a woman’s death was imminent – to the ABC. Doctors, nurses, social workers and friends would all face long jail terms. She said it was “the most frightening piece of fascist legislation I have ever seen in my life”.The League of Rights, a group thought to be backed by the US-based John Birch Society, printed a newsletter with pictures of foetuses and distributed it in Kyburz’s electorate of Salisbury. Des Frawley, the MP for Caboolture, carried the hatchet in parliament.“Her outbursts have been those of a bitter, angry, frustrated woman who has shown herself to be emotionally unstable,” Frawley said.And: “Most of the women who are against this bill are just man-hating women. Most of them cannot even get a man.”The Pregnancy Termination Control Bill passed its first reading. A month later, after the second reading debate, 19 government MPs, including four ministers, crossed the floor and voted it down.“I am [proud] yes, definitely,” Kyburz said. “Their fear tactics didn’t have any effect on me, I was quite determined. I have very bitter memories of how nasty it got.”Queensland doctors accused of 'deep disrespect' for women seeking abortionRead moreClinics raidedOn 20 May 1985, the Queensland police launched Operation Lost Cause. More than 50 officers coordinated raids at two known abortion clinics, in Brisbane and Townsville, and seized 47,000 patient files.“The raids followed several months of secret investigation and planning by specially selected police officers,” the then police assistant commissioner, Bill McArthur, told Brisbane’s afternoon newspaper, the Telegraph.Peter Bayliss, the surgeon who ran the Greenslopes clinic, was later arrested and charged under the criminal code. He was found not guilty at a trial the following year.The judge, Fred Maguire, ruled during the case that abortion was effectively legal if performed to prevent serious danger to a woman’s health.Anne Warner was a shadow minister at the time and a supporter of choice. She recalls great relief at the Maguire ruling and said the case triggered another nasty debate.“The sort of material that came through my letterbox was just nauseating. It’s mind-boggling how offensive they get.”Warner said she discussed abortion with the new premier, Wayne Goss, when Labor won government in 1989.“There was a lot of fear at the time ... I spoke with the usual players and basically they were very scared of the idea of opening up the debate after we’d had such an intense period in the ’80s. We were also scared that if we opened up debate in the wee small hours of the morning someone would move an amendment that would restrict abortion.“I think the feeling at the time was that anybody that touched it would go down. If you tried to tighten the law, you’d go down. If you remove the law, you’d go down.“[At one point] I got a phone call from the premier saying ‘don’t scare the horses’. We’d been out of government for 30 years, change would have to happen slowly and systematically”.Queensland abortion legalisation to be put to conscience voteRead more‘There are no villains, there are just women’Warner and others say they never imagined the pace of reform would be quite so slow. Jackie Trad was at university in the early 1990s, and has been campaigning to decriminalise abortion throughout her political career.Trad, the deputy premier and treasurer, is Labor’s progressive figurehead, an influential figure within government. She is also the latest villain for conservative outrage.“I think Queensland is a different place to what it was when Joh Bjelke-Petersen was ordering police raids,” Trad said.“Fundamentally I know that the majority of Queenslanders recognise that these laws, drafted in 1899 when women didn’t have the vote ... they bear no resemblance to what women experience.“The nastiness we’ve seen from the anti-choice campaign is typical and it’s about creating villains in this debate. There are no villains, there are just women, thousands and thousands of women each year who have had to make really difficult choices.“I am incredibly saddened by how desperate and vicious the anti-choice campaign has been.”Earlier this year, the Liberal National party MP Mark Robinson, a conservative Christian and former pastor, called Trad “Jihad Jackie” on Twitter.“It’s just outside the realms of life,” Trad said. “It’s just weird, crazy stuff. And racist stuff. Calling me a jihadist because I believe a woman should have the right to choose. He really does epitomise the nastiness and the craziness of the anti-choice campaign.”Debate on the abortion decriminalisation bill will begin on Tuesday and may last until Thursday. Most indications are the new laws will pass narrowly.Kyburz said she hoped Queensland would this week “come out of the chrysalis” of Bjelke-Petersen’s ultra-conservative vision for the state. It would be a victory for all those “unstable women”, who for decades had protested and campaigned and refused to be bullied.TopicsAbortionQueenslandfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/queenslands-pro-choice-veterans-hope-for-victory-after-long-and-nasty-fight,Ben Smee,"
'They shot a rifle over my fence': the bitter fight for abortion rights in Queensland
"
"he spring of 2008 was brutal for Europe’s honeybees. In late April and early May, during the corn-planting season, dismayed beekeepers in Germany’s upper Rhine valley looked on as whole colonies perished. Millions of bees died. France, the Netherlands and Italy reported big losses, but in Germany the incident took on the urgency of a national crisis. “It was a disaster,” recalled Walter Haefeker, German president of the European Professional Beekeepers Association. “The government had to set up containers along the autobahn where beekeepers could dump their hives.”An investigationin July of that year concluded that the bees in Germany died of mass poisoning by the pesticide clothianidin, which can be10,000 times more potentthan DDT. In the months leading up to the bee crisis, clothianidin, developed by Bayer Crop Science from a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, had been used up and down the Rhine following an outbreak of corn rootworm. The pesticide is designed to attack the nervous system of crop-munching pests, but studies have shown it can be harmful to insects such as the European honeybee. It muddles the bees’ super-acute sense of direction and upsets their feeding habits, while itcan also alterthe queen’s reproductive anatomy and sterilise males. As contaminated beehives piled up, Bayer paid €2m (£1.76m) into a compensation fund for beekeepers in the affected area, but offered no admission of guilt.The die-offforced a reckoning among European farmers. Hundreds of studies examined the safety of neonicotinoids, known as neonics, and their links to colony collapse disorder (CCD), in which worker bees abandon the hive, leaving the queen and her recent offspring unprotected, to starve. In 2013, the evidence led to a landmark European commission ruling, imposing a moratorium on clothianidin and two other major neonics – the world’s most popular pesticides. This April, Europe went a step further. The commission extended the ban on the trio of neonics to virtually everywhere outside greenhouses, citing evidence that by harming pollinating insects, neonics interfere with thepollination of crops to the value of €15bna year. Environmentalists cheered the victory. Regulators beyond Europe plan to follow.For Haefeker at the beekeepers association, who had spent years campaigning against the use of neonics, victory was sweet, but short-lived: faced with multiple threats from modern farming methods, beekeepers know the insecticide ban alone is not enough to save the honeybee.Honeybees originated in Eurasia roughly 35m years ago, and as long as they have had steady access to flowering plants, they have thrived. But in the modern world, bees face all kinds of dangers.Colony collapseis not a single malady, but rather an amalgamation of different challenges. Alongside the dangers of pesticides, diseases such as Israeli acute paralysis virus, gut parasites and invasive parasites such as the varroa mite can overwhelm the bees’ immune systems. Industrial agriculture imposes its own threats: a mania for monocultures has led to shrinking foraging habitats, while, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, bees employed in commercial pollination, in which hives are stacked high on trucks and driven around the country to pollinate almond trees and other crops, get highly stressed, which damages their resilience and eating habits.Since the EU began phasing out neonics, in 2014, the honeybees’ recovery has not been as dramatic as hoped. Neonics are probably not the biggest factor in the demise of bees, but they are the easiest to outlaw. To farmers, this seems outrageously unfair. Citing an industry-funded study, they say the ban will cost the EU agriculture sector €880bn annually in diminished crop yields.Another, more controversial, response to the slump in bee populations is in the works. This is the plan to create a more resilient strain of honeybee – a genetically modified superbee. The technology for creating GM honeybees is in its infancy, and still confined to the laboratory. But, if successful, it could lead to a hardier species, one that is resistant to natural and manmade hazards: viruses, varroa mites, pesticides and so on. If we can’t change modern farming practices, the thinking goes, maybe we should change the bees.The prospect horrifies many bee people – from commercial beekeepers such as Haefeker to passionate amateurs – who see a lab-made superbee as a direct threat to the smaller, struggling bee species. Traditional beekeepers have a name for them that expresses their fear and suspicion: Frankenbees.Like many beekeepers, Haefeker is an activist and conservationist. A kind of bearded Lorax, Dr Seuss’s valiant spokesman for threatened trees, Haefeker speaks for the bees. For much of the past two decades, he has sounded the alarm on declining bee health, bringing his message to lawmakers in Brussels, Berlin and Munich, before judges at the European court of justice in Luxembourg, to investor roundtables in London, to beekeeper conferences in Istanbul, Austria and Rome, and to corporate gatherings of the agrichemical industry around Europe.When we met in Bavaria a week after the EU extended its neonics ban, I expected Haefeker to be in celebratory mood. But over lunch at a favourite roadway tavern an hour outside Munich, he explained that he considers the development of GM bees – however long it takes to get them in production – an even greater threat to the humble honeybee. “I don’t expect it to be commercialised next week, but then I don’t want to leave anything up to chance,” Haefeker said. “The public has been pretty late on a whole bunch of bad ideas. We don’t want to be late on this one.”Some beekeepers worry that, if the agriculture industry succeeds in building and patenting a blockbuster, mite-free, pesticide-proof superbee, it would dominate and destroy the vibrant local market in conventional bee strains. There are health fears, too: the sting of GM bees may introduce new allergy risks. And beekeepers are afraid they would not be able to protect the gene pool of traditional strains such as the belovedApis mellifera, the scientific name for the European honeybee, against a dominant, pesticide resistant, lab-designed version.Jay Evans heads the bee research lab at the US Department of Agriculture, where they are looking at various threats to bee health. Designing a truly pesticide-resistant honeybee, a “bulletproof bee”, as Evans calls them, would “throw a lot of nature under the bus”.t is always hive-like – 30C and humid – in the narrow, windowless laboratory where genetically engineered honeybees are created on the campus of Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany. One June day, three students in T-shirts were on the morning shift. Two of them silently inspected plastic honeycomb discs. Each disc contained 140 tiny plug holes, in each of which a single honeybee embryo was growing. These discs were then passed to a third student at a separate workstation, where, with remarkable dexterity, she injected each egg with an sgRNA gene-manipulation solution, a main ingredient in a revolutionary new gene-editing technique called Crispr-Cas9.Crispr technologyhas transformed microbiology in recent years by allowing scientists to copy a desirable part of the DNA strand and insert it directly into the chromosome of the target specimen. Now, with great precision, scientists can remove harmful mutations or unwanted traits, or insert a desired trait. In the US, you can buy a Crisprapple that doesn’t brown. Medical researchers, meanwhile, see Crispr as a promising route tomaking mosquitos resistant to the malariaparasite.The director of the Düsseldorf lab is Martin Beye, a giant in the field of evolutionary genetics. In 2003, Beye and his colleagues were the first to pinpoint the gene variants, or alleles, that determine the sex of honeybees. Three years later (coincidentally, just as scientists determined the likely causes of colony collapse disorder), Beye and an international team of biologists decoded theApis melliferahoneybee genome, a breakthrough that transformed the field of bee biology. Scientists now have an understanding of bee health down to the chromosomal level, enabling them, for example, to analyse precisely how pathogens and parasites affect their bee hosts. Genomics can take much of the guesswork out of breeding, too, revealing the precise gene markers that make stocks more resilient to stressors and disease. Once the genome was cracked, it was only a matter of time before the scientific community would build a designer bee. In 2014, Beye’s lab claimed that crown.The gene-injection method Beye’s team pioneered, and laid out in their2014 research paper, is painstaking and fraught with risk. To demonstrate, a student motioned for me to peer into her microscope. The faint outline of a tiny needle and its intended target, the egg, came into focus. Magnified, the egg looked like a smooth grey balloon, the kind performers at children’s parties tie into poodles and giraffes. Poke the egg at the wrong angle, or with too much pressure, or with an imprecise dosage, and it will pop. And the injection has to be stealthy enough to leave no marks. If the worker bees, the hive’s fastidious caretakers, sense in any way the pupae are not perfect, they cast them from the nest, leaving them for dead. Only the pristine survive.FacebookTwitterPinterestHoney bees in flight. Photograph: Andre Skonieczny/Getty/ImagebrokerTo increase the odds of success, Beye’s team keep their injected embryos away from the workers at first, incubating in an artificial hive. Only after 72 hours do they slip the fittest of their modified larvae specimens into a queen-rearing colony. What happens next is similar to the conventional queen-breeding method. The researchers graft the larvae into cell cups lined with royal jelly, the nutrient rich compound that young larvae gorge on to become queens. Even so, the workers, on average, rejected three out of four mutant larvae. But the survival rate was enough to guarantee the birth, in 2014, of the world’s first genetically modified honeybee queens.I was also shown the transgenic queens. Up close, they looked vigorous, but unremarkable. The researchers affixed a magenta-coloured ID tag to the queen’s back, between the base of her wings. She mingled with ordinary worker bees in a small wooden nucleus hive. The sides were made of a hard plastic for viewing. Beye’s research team told me their transgenic bees behave no differently than any otherApis melliferahoneybees. The queen and the workers covered every inch of their cramped confines, popping in and out of a small well containing water. After a week or so, the queen would be moved outside to a flight cage.Beye’s researchers believe manipulating the genome of the European honeybee will lead to new insights into what makes this species unique – which genes make them such meticulous groomers, or which genes programme the worker bees’ super-assiduous attention to looking after their young. They want to know why bees are so good to each other. Is this instinct to work tirelessly for the good of the hive something learned, or genetic?Beekeepers, dismayed at the prospect of GM bees becoming a reality, made a huge fuss about Beye’s work. Many suspected his lab was bankrolled by the agriculture industry, or “Big Ag”.“The beekeeper associations … ” Beye said, shaking his head in lingering disbelief. In person, he is affable and professorial. “They thought we were working with Bayer. I mean, they’re very close by: Bayer’s headquarters is maybe 20km from here.” He insisted inferences of a Bayer connection were totally false.Beye and Marianne Otte, his research partner, explained that the purpose of their work was to understand the genetic basis for bee behaviour and health. It was never to build a pesticide-resistant bee. Building a GM bee, Beye said, is “a stupid idea”. The world doesn’t need chemical-resistant bees, he says. It needs farming practices that don’t harm bees. “They should be working on that. Not on manipulating the bee.”But the truth is that Beye’s highly detailed paper serves as a kind of blueprint for how to build a bee. Thanks to research like his, and the emergence of tools such as Crispr, it has never been cheaper or so straightforward for a chemical company to pursue a superbee resistant to, say, the chemicals it makes. Takeo Kubo, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Tokyo, was the second scientist in the world to make a genetically modified bee in his lab. He told me that he, too, is focused on basic research, and has no ties to the agriculture industry. But, unlike Beye, he welcomes the prospect of GM bee swarms buzzing around the countryside. Lab-made, pesticide-resistant bees could be a real saviour for beekeepers and farmers, he says. And, he adds, the science is no more than three years away. “I’m now 57 years old,” he told me via email, “and completely optimistic to see such transgenic bees in the marketplace in my lifetime!”It is not yet legal to release genetically engineered bees into the wild, but the private sector is already watching closely. One US startup contacted Beye’s lab offering to help commercialise their breakthrough research. Beye said no.Beekeepers tend to see the world through the eyes of their bees. After a few hours in their presence, you too begin to re-evaluate your surroundings. The monochrome sameness of our farmlands – that vast, neat checkerboard of green and brown that feeds us mammals so well – can be a desert for foraging pollinators. The shocking yellow brilliance of rapeseed in blossom each spring can be a reservoir of pesticides. Beekeepers have learned to mitigate the risks and adapt, mainly by moving their hives around an ever-dwindling patch of safe zones. But the genetically modified bee, which can breed with other species and looks just like bees hand-raised from carefully chosen strains, is an altogether more dangerous challenge.Jay Evans at the US agriculture department, an entomologist and beekeeper, admires Beye’s work, but thinks his breakthrough GM bee should remain confined to the lab. “The road to making a superbee looks really long to me, and probably not necessary,” he said. “I don’t see the justification.”aefeker, a former tech entrepreneur, came to beekeeping late in life, around his 40th birthday. After spending two decades in Silicon Valley, he, his wife and two sons returned home to Germany in 2001, settling in a picturesque village on Lake Starnberg, halfway between Munich and the Bavarian Alps. What started as a backyard hobby quickly became an obsession, then a growing business. Haefeker studied everything about beekeeping, from hive maintenance to nutrition. Later, he developed an iPhone app for breeders called iQueen and started apodcast calledBienenpolitik, or Beekeeping and Politics. One of the few tech-savvy beekeepers in bucolic Upper Bavaria, in 2003 Haefeker was recruited to join the local professional beekeepers association where second- and third-generation beekeepers routinely grumbled about modern farming practices gobbling up open space. His first assignment was to investigate an issue that nobody at the organisation knew much about: GM crops. “I had no opinion of GMOs (genetically modified organisms),” he recalls. “But as the new kid on the block it was my job to figure out: is this going to have an impact on us?”Haefeker’s investigations into GMOs turned into a decade-long crusade. What began as a local case involving a Bavarian beekeeper with GMO-contaminated honey grew into an epic battle, pitting Europe’s beekeepers against two giants: Monsanto, the biotech giant that markets MON810, the pest-resistant genetically modified maize, and the World Trade Organization, which, at the time, was pressuring the EU to give GM crops a chance. The beekeepers eventuallywon a huge victory in 2011in the European court of justice, keeping European honey, for now, virtually GMO-free. The fight continues, but the beekeepers’ message was clear: don’t underestimate us.FacebookTwitterPinterestA beekeeper in California with his hives. Photograph: Brett MurphyThe agrichemical companies’ business model is to dominate both ends of the market. They sell the farmer the chemical that kills the pests, and then they sell them their patented seeds, genetically engineered to withstand those very chemicals. (Monsanto’s top-selling line of Roundup Ready herbicide-resistant seeds are marketed as the best defence against Roundup, Monsanto’s top-selling herbicide.) The multinationals have locked farmers into contracts that prevent them from manipulating the seeds to develop their own cross-breed.Beekeepers fear genetic engineering of honeybees will introduce patents and privatisation to one of the last bastions of agriculture that is collectively managed and owned by no one. “Think about it,” Haefeker told me, “the one area Big Ag doesn’t yet control is pollination.” And pollination is huge. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)estimates that pollinatorshelp farmers grow crops worth up to $577bn (£437bn) annually.Damage to the bee population, by harming a vital pollinator, is already threatening crops worldwide. Outside FAO’s headquarters in Rome, a neon billboard flashes in English, Italian and Arabic a series of urgent save-the-planet messages. Save the bees tops the list. If bees disappear, food crops and animal feeds, not to mention the raw materials for biofuels (from canola and palm oil), textiles (cotton) and medicines, will simply vanish from much of the planet. It has got so badin some parts of Chinathat humans already pollinate some crops by hand. In what feels like a riff on aBlack Mirrorepisode, Harvard researchers are working on theRoboBee, a flying robotic pollinator that is half the size of a paperclip and weighs less than one-tenth of a gram. In March, Walmartfiled a series of patentsfor its own tiny robotic pollinators.Beekeepers and conservationists believe bees should be left to evolve on their own, helped only by protection of open spaces and best-practice natural breeding methods. Conventional bee breeding has embraced technology in recent years via the introduction of apps, tracking software and temperature-controlled “finishing” incubators. But the method is otherwise little changed from ancient times. During the year, beekeepers will perform what they call “splitting the hive”, or separating a portion of the colony, frame by frame, and putting the frames in new hives with new inhabitants. This can invigorate the gene pool by introducing hardy newcomers.“Before the introduction of neonicotinoids,” Haefeker said, “about 15 years ago, you’d open up the hive and it was bursting with healthy bees. That level of reproductive energy is really crucial.”During 2008, Germany’s infamous season of heavy colony losses, the dead piled up on the ground under Haefeker’s hives and along the hive’s inner floor. “It’s got better in recent years, since the bans went into place. But we’re not yet back to where we were in the days before neonics,” he said. “That will take years.” He tests the spring pollen for traces of neonics and other chemicals. The level of contamination is much improved, he says. On his property in Bavaria, he offered me a pinch of raw pollen. The sharp, sweet taste lingered on my tongue. I peered down to get a good look at the workers entering one of the hives. They streamed in one by one, their thighs weighed down with yellow balls of dandelion pollen. “It’s good, isn’t it?” Haefeker chuckled proudly.By late July, cracks had appeared in the new neonics law. More than a dozen EU member statessought loopholesto stay the ban, andBayer pledged to appealagainst its legal basis, warning that the ban would limit our ability to grow the quantities of “safe, affordable” food we need.Despite the setback, Haefeker remains defiant. “Their business model is obsolete,” he told me on the phone in July. The “big six” companies of Big Ag are in the process of merging into three, forming Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont and Syngenta-ChemChina. This historic, quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar spending spree is a sign of market uncertainty, Haefeker asserts, not strength. The future, he says, is big data. Sensor- and computer-assisted crop care – digital crop protection, as it is known, in which tiny robots and drones will tend to rows and rows of crops round the clock, picking off pests and releasing super-precise flows of irrigation – will feed the planet’s billions, not chemicals. “I’ve been telling them this for years.”However ground down by Haefeker’s tireless advocacy for bees they may be, Bayer officials told me they largely concur with his view that the industry is beginning to grow less reliant on chemicals, and investing more in big data and tiny robots. They even let Haefeker in the building from time to time to discuss that digital future.umans have been consuming honey since our hunter-gatherer days. Not long after we began farming, we started keeping bees (sugar came several millennia later). About 10,000 years agoartists depicted apicultureon the walls of Spanish caves, and, centuries after that, demand for bees wax and honey drove commerce across the empires of ancient Greece and Rome. In the 20th century, apiology, the study of bees, took off. In the 1920s, Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch was the first to explain the meaning of the honeybees’ waggle dance, which communicates to other bees the direction and distance of a food source; a half-century later he won the Nobel Prize. Honeybees are eusocial creatures, making them one of the most studied insects on the planet. Researchers study the species to understandhow the human brainworks and to improve the design of supercomputers. Bees, it turns out,can even do abstract maths.There are 22 million beekeepers across 146 countries, estimates Apimondia, a 123-year-old organisation that protects and promotes the livelihood of beekeepers, and lately they have been seeing a dramatic rise in membership. “During a downturn in the economy of a country, the number of new members increases,” Philip McCabe, an Irish beekeeper and president of Apimondia, told me. The media attention around colony collapse and bee health continues to bring in new members as well.In October, 2017, Haefeker delivered a presentation at Apimondia’s International Apicultural Congress in Istanbul, unveiling Apimondia’s answer to Frankenbees. Like Haefeker himself, the fix he proposes is geeky and left-leaning: anopen-source license for honeybees. A software engineer, he takes inspiration from the free software movement of the 1980s and 90s, which gave birth to the “open source” concept. Now, he sees such a licence promoting open collaboration as the perfect model to protect the beekeepers from a nightmare scenario – powerful corporations building a genetically engineered bee that they then commercialise and lock down with patents and trademarks.FacebookTwitterPinterestA bee covered in pollen from a sunflower. Photograph: EPAIn his opening remarks, Haefeker launched into what he called “the big question”. “Did anybody ask our permission before they took our bees, the bees we have been working on, selecting and breeding within Apimondia, before the scientists decided to take these bees and modify them?” The answer was, of course, no. Until that moment, nobody, not even beekeepers, claimed an ownership stake on the bees’ genetic code. Anyone can start a hive, which might explain why you can find beekeepers tending to hives inYemeni war zones, on the roof ofParis’ Bastille opera houseand inTanzanian refugee camps. The free exchange of breeding materials – from the queens and her eggs to the drones’ sperm – has long been encouraged to keep colonies genetically diverse. Through this free exchange, we preserve a common resource, benefitting everyone and everything. The beekeepers get healthier colonies out of the arrangement. We get flowers, food and honey.To get around any attempt by the agriculture industry to distribute and license superbees, Apimondia is seeking to enshrine this freedom as a right in the form of an open-source contract, establishing bee breeding as a public good that nobody can own outright.“This is the most efficient way to legally protect our bees from patenting and privatisation by commercial interests,” Haefeker insists. Later, he told me, “we don’t want to get screwed, the way farmers did by corporations and their GM patented seeds.”Apimondia has minuscule lobbying resources, but it has lined up powerful allies, including the FAO, environmental NGOs and scientific advisers. Together, they press for international treaties to protect vital pollinators. Now Apimondia, too, is sounding the alarm on GM honeybees. Radical bee-breeding experiments don’t always end well, McCabe reminded me. Beekeepers won’t soon forget the story of the Africanised bee, a cross-breed between the African bee and European strains introduced in South America in the 1950s. It escaped quarantine, mated with indigenous species and then multiplied and multiplied, venturing thousands of miles north into the US, breeding with local species and quickly coming to dominate their gene pool. It landed the unfortunate, even nativist, nickname “African killer bee” for the aggressive manner in which it defends its nest. “That’s what we’re concerned with,” McCabe says, “any inter-breeding that messes with the genetics of indigenous bee populations.”Jay Evans keeps bees on the grounds of his job at the USDA, at the government research facility in Maryland, 30 minutes north of Washington DC. I contacted him by phone and asked how things were going.“Terribly,” he said with a wry laugh. “The losses have doubled in the last 10 years.” He blames a host of factors, with disease and parasites such as the varroa mite chief among them. Beekeepers, he added, are closely watching what happens next in Europe. “I go to beekeepers’ meetings all the time. They’re suffering. They’re trying to keep their operations afloat. They’re desperate for a new solution, or technology, or regulation. Anything,” he says. But there’s consensus on what they don’t want. “When I talk to a group, I talk a lot about genetics. And occasionally they’ll say: ‘Are you making a transgenic bee, one of those Frankenbees?’”aefeker and his business partner, Arno Bruder, run their beekeeping enterprise on a field bordering two organic farms in Upper Bavaria. Their colonies have recovered somewhat since the neonics ban went into effect, he said, but they take steps to protect their hives. A lot of beekeepers pack their hives on to trailers and position them near nature reserves or in fields like the one in which we stood. “Over time you learn where you have the worst exposure to whatever it is that harms the bees,” Haefeker said.He pulled out a frame to reveal a queen. Like an awkward commuter on the tube, she brushed up against every inhabitant near her as she made her way from one end of the frame to the other. The jostling has a purpose; it reassures the cavorting masses. “It’s the queen’s pheromones,” he explained. It makes them relaxed and productive. “The pheromones affect us beekeepers, too.” He says he plans to harness this anti-stress essence and build a kind of a bee-powered wellness centre on the two-hectare property. I pictured Munich’s pampered classes soaking up queen-bee pheromones in a lodge in the hills around Lake Starnberg. A moment later, Haefeker put the frame back, closed the lid, and surveyed his hives with satisfaction. He and Bruder then discussed what’s next.Keeping bees safe from pesticides is labour-intensive and requires specialist local knowledge. Bruder agreed to wake before dawn the following morning and pack up some of the hives, load them on to a trailer and drive the bees to higher ground. They had decided on a region in the foothills of the Alps, about an hour away,near the Wieskirche, an 18th-century church on the Unesco world heritage list. There would be fresh dandelion flowers up there. The bees would be further away from intensive agriculture, said Haefeker. “We’ve scouted out the locations.”‘A different dimension of loss’: inside the great insect die-offRead moreMeanwhile, it is possible that humankind has even more extreme designs on bees. Earlier this month, Haefeker sent me a message pointing to something calledInsect Allies, a $45m research project sponsored by Darpa, the US Department of Defense’s military research department. It proposes using insects to carry immune-boosting mutations designed to protect crops from drought, flooding, pathogens and bioweapons. In essence, the visiting insects would modify the plant’s genetic makeup. A group of academics from universities in Germany and France declared the programme’s existence alarming,saying it turns the insectsthemselves into bioweapons.Darpa does not say what kind of insects it plans to use, but Haefeker did not like the sound of it. “We need to keep an eye on this craziness,” his text read, “in case they want to use bees to transport their genetically modified viruses into crops.”Follow the Long Read on Twitter at@gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly emailhereThis main image in this article was changed on 16 October 2018 to replace a photograph of a hoverfly.TopicsThe long readWildlifeInsectsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/16/frankenbees-genetically-modified-pollinators-danger-of-building-a-better-bee,Bernhard Warner,
"‘Ididn’t think all of these people would care,” Steven Avery says, in wonder, atthe beginning of the trailerfor Making a Murderer: Part 2.But people did care; they cared a lot. When the first series of Making a Murderer launched on Netflix in 2015, millions of people around the world were transfixed by the true story of Avery, a Wisconsin man convicted of murdering a local photographer, Teresa Halbach. There was a frenzy of interest about whether Avery had killed Halbach or whether he had been, as the series seems to suggest, a victim of police misconduct.Making a Murdererquickly became a bona fide cultural phenomenon, arguably the biggest true-crime documentary of all time.Not everyone was thrilled by the documentary’s success, however. “I’ve had 4,000 death threats since Making a Murderer first aired,” says Ken Kratz, the prosecutor who helped put Avery behind bars. “I’ve had packages explode in my office. I’ve had my car shot at.” He sighs. “I suspect all that craziness is going to be unleashed again.” The sequel to Making a Murderer comes out on 19 October and Kratz is apprehensive about what news it could contain. “Their tag line is something to the effect of: ‘The case is not over yet,’” he says. “Well, when is it over? From my perspective, this case is over.”Kratz may have had enough of Making a Murderer, but the rest of us clearly have not: the sequel has already drawn extensive press coverage. And it’s not just Making a Murderer. It seems as if many of us can’t get enough of murder, full stop. In recent years, true crimehas become a pervasive part of popular culture.A lot of the credit, or blame, lies with the podcast Serial, which followed the case of Adnan Syed, convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 2000. When it launched in 2014, Serial smashed all podcast records. The first season has been downloaded more than 211m times and a third, which focuses on the Cleveland court system, launched last month. It has also been turned into an HBO show,The Case Against Adnan Syed, coming out soon.FacebookTwitterPinterestHae Min Lee. Photograph: HandoutTrue-crime successes continue to come thick and fast. Last year, for example, the LA Times podcastDirty John, which details the violent web of deceit spun by supposed “freelance anesthesiologist” John Meehan, was downloaded more than 10m times in six weeks. It has also been turned into a TV show, starring Eric Bana, which will premiere next month.Meanwhile, there are true-crime TV channels such as Investigation Discovery, with a nonstop schedule of shows such as Evil Twins, Evil Stepmothers and Evil Lives Here. For those who prefer a more hands-on homicide experience, there’s an annual convention, CrimeCon, where you can mingle with other murder aficionados at events such as Wine &Crimeor test your mettle at an interrogation experience. You can also shop for serial killer swag on Etsy, which boasts a disturbing amount of murder merch, from coffee mugs decorated with names of famous killers to blood-splattered hair-ties.Michael Arntfield, a former police officer who now runs a cold-case thinktank, notes that our interest in “ripped from the headlines” stories of depravity is not a modern phenomenon. The genre, Arntfield says, really “crystallised in 1842 when Edgar Allan Poe wrote The Mystery of Marie Rogêt”, a short story based on a contemporaneous killing. Since then, Arntfield says, the genre “has been intermittently influential and has come and gone generationally”. There has been nothing quite like the quality and quantity of attention we’re seeing today, however.Once a guilty pleasure associated with rubberneckers and cheap, gory magazines, true crime has “moved out of the gutter”, says Jean Murley, author of The Rise of True Crime: 20th-Century Murder and American Popular Culture. “It hasn’t necessarily become highbrow entertainment, but it has a lot more cultural cachet.People aren’t ashamed of likingit the way they were 10 years ago.” In a virtuous circle, a rise in high-quality true-crime content has created a wide audience, which means that more high-quality content gets made.Technology has also assisted the gentrification of gore. As Arntfield notes, new production platforms such as Netflix allow for “greater experimentation with long-form storytelling. Rather than telling a whodunnit in an hour, shows like The Staircase and Making a Murderer have taken true crime in a new direction which is more experiential.”The Staircase covers the trial of the novelist Michael Peterson for the murder of his wife, Kathleen, who was found dead at the bottom of the staircase in their North Carolina home in 2001. Eight episodes on the original trial were released on French TV in 2004. Another two episodes followed in 2013. After a retrial, three new episodes, together with the 10 previous, were released on Netflix this year. A story spanning almost two decades was condensed into an extremely bingeable but also nuanced series.As well as changing how true-crime stories are told, technology has democratised who gets to tell them. As Arntfield says, it is relatively easy for anyone with a knack for narrative and an internet connection to dig up an interesting cold case and turn it into a podcast. “Access was always the issue before. Unless you worked on the original case, you didn’t have access to the information you needed to tell these stories.” Now, however, “we’re realising how many stories are out there. There’s a limitless amount of material.”FacebookTwitterPinterestThe Staircase. Photograph: NetflixShould it all be used, though? These aren’t just stories – they are real people’s lives. No matter how tastefully it is done, is it not unethical to transform personal tragedies into public entertainment?It depends on how you define entertainment, says Christopher Goffard, the host and creator of Dirty John. “My aim is storytelling that explores important psychological questions with a respect for human complexity and ambiguity … To insist on hard lines between journalism and entertainment is to assume that journalism has to be boring or it’s not authentic, which I don’t buy.”Goffard also notes that true-crime stories can sometimes be more powerful than traditional journalism. “One issue at the heart of Dirty John is something called coercive control, which is a form of psychological manipulation that involves things like gaslighting, microsurveillance and isolation of a domestic partner – control that masquerades as love. I could have done a story quoting a handful of people who have endured this, and found some experts to talk about it, and it would have been a respectable story and maybe sparked some conversation. But I think the effect is hugely magnified when the story takes you deep inside one family’s experience, so you get to hear what it felt like to live it.”Others, however, seem to have spent less time pondering the ethics of true crime.Take Payne Lindsey, the host of another hit podcast, Up and Vanished. In the first episode, Lindsey explains the genesis of the series, which examines missing-person cases. “Like a lot of people, I had been pretty obsessed with the podcastSerial, and the Netflix series Making a Murderer, and I thought to myself: ‘What if I made one of those?’” he says. “So I literally just went to Google and started searching.”The satirists of the Onion parodied this sort of self-absorbed approachin a podcast called A Very Fatal Murder. Released this year, it features “David Pascall”, a narcissistic Brooklynite who decides to parachute into Bluff Springs, small-town America, to solve the death of a pretty young girl called Hayley Price and maybe win some awards in the process. “So, what happened to Hayley Price?” Pascall asks. “And how can I get in on it?” Katy Yeiser, the head writer on A Very Fatal Murder, notes that among the many true-crime tropes ripe for mockery is the “self-aggrandising host exploiting a young woman’s death”.Sometimes, of course, true-crime programmes succeed where the authorities have failed and give a voice to victims who have been silenced. These stories aren’t just being told, they are being re-investigated. The internet allows people to trade theories, hunt down clues and influence the narrative.One of the best examples was last year’s Netflix documentary The Keepers, which examined the unsolved murder in1969 of a Baltimore nun, Sister Cathy Cesnik. The series follows two of her former students, now in their 60s, as they investigate how she was failed by patriarchal systems of power, from the Roman Catholic church to the Baltimore police force.FacebookTwitterPinterestSister Cathy Cesnik in 1969. Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixThe “Grandma Nancy Drews” Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub had been working with the journalist Tom Nugent to try to draw attention to the murder of Cesnik years before the documentary was made; only in 2014 did some film-makers came knocking. The current obsession with true crime, you could argue, helped propel Hoskins and Schaub’s years ofoverlooked industry into the national spotlightHoskins has worked hard to maintain the interest thatThe Keepers has sparked in the Cesnik case, using social media to crowdsource clues for the investigation. She’s in the middle of following a new lead when I call her at her Maryland home. “There were supposedly two hunters hunting small game who found Sister Cathy’s body. They’re only named in one article. I want to find them before they’re both dead.” Hoskins has a team of about 30 volunteers, recruited via Facebook, trawling the internet in an attempt to identify these hunters.Already The Keepers has led to important developments in the case. Shortly after the documentary was released, the Baltimore police departmentstarted to offer an online formfor victims of sex offences related to the events it covered. “It’s surreal,” says Hoskins. “I’m thinking Pope Francis probably knows who I am! It’s hard for me to grapple with the fact that I have a voice now and that people are listening.”Australian podcast The Teacher’s Pet is another example of true crime making a difference. The podcast, which launched this year and has been downloaded more than 24m times, looks at the disappearance of 33-year-old Lyn Dawson from her home in Sydney in 1982. Nobody was charged in connection with the disappearance.Hedley Thomas, the creator of The Teacher’s Pet, says the information that came in after episode one of the podcast aired changed the course of the whole series. “Very quickly people started contacting me, wanting to share information and things they’d witnessed, so I had to rewrite the next two episodes.” The fact that The Teacher’s Pet wasn’t entirely scripted but unfolded week by week, he says, “made a big difference to the material that I started to discover”. It made listeners feel that they were an active part of the investigation.“When I first went to the police to see if they’d cooperate,” he recalls, “they didn’t want to have anything to do with the podcast. But during the series, people were contacting me that the police hadn’t heard about. Suddenly there was this change of attitude. The police commissioner himself knew he had to utilise the momentum of what was happening and get new information into the hands of investigators.”Lyn Dawson’s family, says Thomas, are delighted by the success of the podcast. “Lyn’s brother has said that the podcast has given them the best hope they have ever had that this case will lead to a prosecution, which should have happened years ago.” However, not all victims’ families are so thrilled that old wounds are being reopened. While stories such as Making a Murderer, Serial or The Staircase, which seek to exonerate convicted killers, have been praised forexposing flaws in the criminal justice system, they have also been accused of exploiting the deaths of the women involved and preventing their families from getting closure.'We're all car-crash snoopers now': the truth about the TV true-crime waveRead moreIn 2016, the public interest that Serial created in the Adnen Syed case resulted in his conviction being overturned and a judge ordering a new trial. While many Serial fans were ecstatic about this development, Hae Min Lee’s family lamented the fact that it had “reopened wounds few can imagine”. In a rare statement the family said: “It remains hard to see so many run to defend someone who committed a horrible crime … when so few are willing to speak up for Hae.”Appeals by prosecutors have delayed Syed’s retrial, but it is looking likely that it will happen soon. This will, no doubt, cause a new surge of media interest and make it even harder for Lee’s family to make peace with the past. The same is true of the sequel to Making a Murderer. While Halbach’s relatives have largely remained quiet about the Netflix series, they have said the showtraumatised the familyall over again.Whatever the ethical arguments about true crime, its popularity seems unlikely to run out any time soon. “At some point down the line, using a podcast or serial documentary to tell true-crime narratives will become less trendy,” A Very Fatal Murder’s Katy Yeiser says. “But true crime will not go away. It will just be told through some other or new medium. We will never grow tired of murder.”TopicsMediaTrue crime booksSerialMaking a MurdererPodcastingPodcastsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/16/making-a-murderer-is-our-obsession-with-true-crime-turning-nasty-serial,Arwa Mahdawi,"

"Test cricket is all about momentum shifts and contrasts. None more so than this. After the long slow unfolding of the first Test’s classic draw, the second Test between Pakistan and Australia in Abu Dhabi started in fast-forward.Even though the pitch had some grass left on it and produced some bounce, Australia would have been dreading another first-day grind, losing the toss for the second time in the series and asked to bowl at a ground where the average first-innings score is north of 400.Instead they were part of a day that shifted like the desert dunes surrounding the stadium. It involved records, collapses, counterattacks and flourishes, a rush of wickets and two near-centuries, as Australia dismissed Pakistan for 282, then fell to two for 20 themselves by stumps.From living-room commentary to buying radio rights for Australian Tests | Adam CollinsRead moreIt was a cinematic day, nothing happening in expected fashion. The first breakthrough was suitably unorthodox, Mohammed Hafeez following a century in the first Test by glancing Mitchell Starc. It was flush off the face of the bat, but hit the short-leg fieldsman Marnus Labuschagne in the box. Television cameras measured reaction time, but the catcher hadn’t had time to move a muscle.He did react when the rebound hit his knee and bobbled up as he fell. While spinning a half circle and rolling onto his back, Labuschagne knocked it up onto his chest and clasped it there with both legs. He had turned a late 1980s breakdance move into a completed catch according to the Laws of the game. Still, it looked like the only joy Australia would experience as Pakistan powered on with a 50-run stand. Fakhar Zaman was on debut, the man known for his blazing batting in white-ball cricket that included a century to win last year’s Champions Trophy final, and a double-hundred in a one-dayer last July.He had been hitting them well, carving runs from the fast bowlers, when he drove spinner Jon Holland straight to midwicket. Perhaps confused by the lack of initial groin contact, Labuschagne dropped the catch. There were visions of a long day of punishment ahead.But while Fakhar went on, his teammates did not. As Nathan Lyon sent down his off-breaks, Azhar Ali chipped a return catch. Haris Sohail had made a century in the first Test, but followed up with a golden duck as he squeezed Lyon’s next ball to Travis Head at silly mid-off.The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.The over ended, and Lyon’s hat-trick ball to start his next was seen out by Asad Shafiq. Not so the ball to follow, which a smart DRS referral found had taken an edge into the pad on its way to Labuschagne at short leg. With visions of taking the attack back to Australia, Babar Azam skipped down the wicket two balls later to punt Lyon over long-on. Instead the ball met leg stump. Pakistan had been 57 for one, then were 57 for five. Lyon had four wickets for none.In the process, he overtook Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson to become Australia’s fourth-highest wicket taker. With 314 to his name, the only names now ahead of him read Lillee, McGrath, and Warne. The off-spinner can no longer be underestimated. His nickname of ‘Goat’ grows less satirical by the match.But Pakistan were not done. In keeping with the strangeness of the day, their two most attacking players were tasked with forming a rearguard. Fakhar fought against his instincts, finding Lyon especially was gaining bounce and turn. “There was a bit of moisture in the wicket,” he told the Wisden TestCricketradio broadcast after play. “Safi plays spin really well, always. He was feeling comfortable, but I was not comfortable against the spinners. That’s why I was blocking the ball and taking my time.”Sarfraz took the initiative not with slogs or carves, but by staying busy and running hard. He took guard well outside leg stump at times to throw off Lyon’s rhythm. “He’s got one of the lowest dot-ball percentages in the game,” said Lyon. “I found it quite humorous how far he was going outside, but I just tried to bowl him my best ball.”FacebookTwitterPinterestPakistan’s Bilal Asif misses the ball. Photograph: Kamran Jebreili/APSarfraz’s tactics worked, though. Giving himself space, he was able to cut repeatedly off his stumps, or drive through cover. The Australians couldn’t pin him down: he barely faced more than a couple of balls before rotating strike. Tim Paine tried leaving sweepers out to stifle the scoring, but Sarfraz used it to facilitate his method.Fakhar got moving with a straight six from Holland to enter the 90s, then a reverse sweep. But having added 147 together, another swing arrived.Labuschagne is in this team as a batsman, but has made his mark with the ball and in the field. His quick, skiddy leg-breaks trapped Fakhar in the last over before tea for 94, the debut century tantalisingly close. He came back after the break to have Bilal Asif caught behind for 12, and after a tired Sarfraz took a nasty blow to the elbow from a Mitchell Starc bouncer, he was out for 94 trying to launch Labuschagne over cover. Peter Siddle took it on the third juggle after it bounced off his nose – Australian catches were being completed with every body part bar hands. The part-timer Labuschagne finished with a vital three for 45.Despite late hitting from leg-spinner Yasir Shah with 28, a score of 282 would have delighted Australia at the start of the day. Then the final twist: Mohammad Abbas, so penetrative outside off stump, got Australia’s key man Usman Khawaja down the leg side, Sarfraz forgetting his exhaustion and injured arm to fly to his right.Nightwatchman Siddle was lbw on referral to the final scheduled ball of the day, taking Pakistan to stumps with some wind back in their sails. It was only fitting, given the amount of action and intrigue one day had contained. The teams will resume with the match and the series perfectly set up for a result.TopicsCricketAustralia cricket teamPakistan cricket teamAustralia sportmatch reportsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/16/australia-and-pakistan-join-hands-for-abu-dhabi-rollercoaster-ride,Geoff Lemon,"

"I thought it would be cold. Not just cold, but colder than anything I had experienced in my life. I had visions of bedraggled explorers in blizzards with ice-covered beards.But standing there, in the bright Antarctic sun, watching creaking blue icebergs, penguins bursting in and out of the water, I felt utterly content in this glistening wilderness.What I hadn’t thought about was the dark. And not the dark of night – although as a European, that brought a dazzling new astronomy of the southern hemisphere to me – but the dark of the deep, icy, ocean depths. I was going almost half a kilometre down to the Antarctic seafloor.It was back in January of this year, and I had joined a Greenpeace research expedition as part of a campaign to create a vastAntarcticoceansanctuary. At 1.8m square kilometres, it would be five times the size of Germany. If it’s created, which it could be when governments meet in the next few weeks, it would be the largest protected area anywhere on Earth. I am one of two million people who want it to happen.Scientists on the ship were using tiny submersibles to go where humans had never been before to explore ecosystems we know so little about: deep habitats they had been looking at on screens all their working lives but had never seen with their own eyes. The excitement was more arresting than the cold of the Antarctic summer.So there I was, descending, in a small, two-person submarine to the frontiers of human knowledge. The light faded, and the sea around us turned a heavy blue. As we sank to hundreds of metres below the surface, I was surrounded by a thick blackness. It was a colour that I had no idea the ocean could turn. Pitch black.FacebookTwitterPinterestChinstrap penguins at Orne harbour in the Antarctic. Photograph: Christian Åslund/GreenpeaceA torch at the front of the submarine shone like a night-light for a child afraid of the dark. It showed the way to the seabed.The sight as it came into view was staggering. Out of the dark and freezing depths emerged a moving, crawling, vibrant mass of life.The temperature is so low that vegetation barely survives down here. Nearlyeverything is an animal: bizarre and ghostly icefish that are semi-transparent; sea spiders that look like something out of a science-fiction film; colourful, tendrilled, feather stars, basket stars, corals, sponges.I’m told that more people have been to the moon than have been to the bottom of the Antarctic ocean. Maybe that’s apocryphal, but it certainly feels like it. We know precious little about this alien environment, which is why it is so crucial to protect it before it is too late.Emerging back into the light at the surface, the bubbles of the submarine hull clearing, it was like waking from a dream, the intangible creatures of the abyss left far behind.I had truly seen the light and the dark of the Antarctic. At its surface, penguin colonies stretch for miles on snow-capped islands, with millions of breeding pairs across the region, raising their chicks in this inhospitable environment. Enormous whales surface all around, feeding on huge pink clouds of the small shrimp-like krill, which nearly all wildlife hererelies on. Fur seals andelephant sealslounge on drifting blocks of ice. While below, another world goes on existing in dark vitality.FacebookTwitterPinterestUnderwater view of the submarine Little Planet, part of the Greenpeace expedition. Photograph: GreenpeaceSo often, we lament the destruction of the environment once it has taken place. And it is true that wildlife in the Antarctic is facing threats from climate change, pollution and industrial fishing. But this area still remains one of the least-touched regions on the planet.Right now, we have an opportunity to protect this place. The governments responsible for conservation of the Antarctic’s waters meet in Hobart, Australia, in the second half of October. What better conservation of the Antarctic ocean could there be than the creation of the largest protected area on Earth at its heart, in theWeddell sea. It would put the area off-limits to future human activity, protect wildlife such as penguins, seals and whales, and help to tackle climate change.I am proud to stand as one person in a movement of more than two million that has come together this year to demand world leaders protect the Antarctic.Creatures of the cold: the Antarctic photography exhibition – in picturesRead moreMost of these people will never visit the Antarctic, but their passion for protecting it inspires me. Across the world, people have written to their politicians; they have encouraged their friends and family to take action; they have dressed up as penguins and danced on ice to raise awareness from the streets of Buenos Aires to Beijing; they have installed penguin sculptures from Johannesburg to Seoul. This is a global movement for a region that belongs to us all.Now, as governments prepare to meet at the Antarctic ocean commission there are millions of eyes watching them and urging them to act. To secure the Antarctic for future generations. To allow its abundance of wildlife to flourish and its migratory species to thrive between the world’s oceans. To help create healthy oceans that contribute to global food security. To preserve the Antarctic ocean’s functions as one of the world’s largest carbon stores. Because, truly, what happens in the Antarctic affects us all.Javier Bardem is an Oscar-winning actor and an Antarctic ambassador forGreenpeaceTopicsOpinionWildlifeGreenpeaceEnvironmental activismcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/antarctic-ocean-sanctuary-climate-change-javier-bardem,Javier Bardem,
"xciting news for cinephiles this week, asLuca Guadagnino, director ofCall Me By Your Name, has announced that for his next film he will be making a film adaptation of the album Blood on the Tracks, by the Nobel Prize-winning authorBob Dylan. Aprofile of the directorin the New Yorker this week carries the revelation that a producer of Call Me By Your Name had acquired theatrical rights to the album – in itself a point of interest for anyone who didn’t know that albumshadtheatrical rights – and asked Guadagnino to turn it into a film.FacebookTwitterPinterestIn turn, Guadagnino askedRichard LaGraveneseto write the thing, resulting in a screenplay that, we are told, follows characters “through a multiyear story, set in the seventies, drawing on the album’s central themes”. Guadagnino adds cryptically that the film will “dramatize the repression, and what that does to them”. Not that Dylan was repressing all that much when he wrote: “Idiot wind / Blowing every time you move your teeth / You’re an idiot, babe / It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe.” But we’ll let it slide.The news is particularly delectable since it would seem to mark the first occasion an album has been adapted to the screen, however vaguely. This places the film in a thrilling modern pantheon of movies adapted from unexpected or quirky things, such as fairground rides (Pirates of the Caribbean), episodes of This American Life (The Informant), video games (The Angry Birds Movie), or emoji (The Emoji Movie, which, let us not forget, starred Patrick Stewart as poo).FacebookTwitterPinterestHeath Ledger as Dylan I’m Not There. Photograph: Weinstein/Everett/Rex FeaturesOther questions emerge, beyond the central one of whether Guadagnino is wanting for inspiration. The project comes after a frantic few years for the director, following on fromA Bigger Splash, Call Me By Your Name, a remake ofSuspiria, and the Jake Gyllenhaal-starring thrillerRio, from which he has now been removed as director. On top of this, the endlessly mooted sequel to Call Me By Your Name is still apparently on the cards, despiteAndré Aciman, the author of the book on which the film is based, stating: “Nonsense! There’s not going to be any sequel!”For one thing, the “central themes” of the Blood on the Tracks years have already been put on screen quite brilliantly – albeit more indirectly – by Todd Haynes in his Bob Dylan movie,I’m Not There. Haynes visits 70s Dylan at a tangent, lifting the events of his dissolving marriage to Sara and transposing them on to the figures of Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) and Claire, his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg). This segment plays in the film as a sort of mini-drama in its own right, among some of the more folksy takes on Dylan’s life and music. This difference fills the section with appropriate pathos, showing perfectly how, at this stage of his career, Dylan presented himself more openly, with more vulnerability than previously.Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks - review: archive, 8 February 1975Read moreAt the same time, I’m Not There could provide clues as to how to adapt an album. Guadagnino doesn’t reveal if there will be any attempts to adapt thesoundof the record, which is as much a part of the album as the lyrics and stories, but Haynes evokes something of Dylan’s looseness, his imagination, his obduracy, too, in the freewheeling section of his film, involving Richard Gere as Billy the Kid. The idea of adapting an album might work, but it would surely be a shame to lose musicality at the expense of telling a straight-up story.Beyond these concerns we expect with great impatience a new deluge of album-films, which will surely rescue that noble but endangered music format by paring the records down to easily digestible stories – not least since Blood on the Tracks is not at first glance the most cinematic of all records.Barry Jenkins’ take on Stevie Wonder’s Innervisions must surely not be far down the line, telling the story of a boy born in hard town Mississippi, who travels to the city, falls in love with a Golden Lady and gets too high. InBen Wheatley’s A Grand Don’t Come For Free, Lily James would seem to be a dead cert for the role of a woman who is fit but, unfortunately, knows it.I yearn for a film adaptation of Sepultura’s classic 1993 album Chaos AD, perhaps shepherded to the screen byDavid Fincher, with a long section devoted to the pulsating ditty Biotech Is Godzilla, which thrillingly elaborates a bleak worldview of pharmaceutical companies creating diseases, such as Aids, in order to reap the financial rewards of tending to them. Meanwhile, we await Guadagnino’s pioneering lead with bated breath.TopicsFilmBob DylanPop and rockfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/16/blood-on-the-tracks-film-luca-guadagnino-bob-dylan,Caspar Salmon,"

"A key player in the US-Saudi relationship is conspicuously missing fromthe talks held in Riyadh by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to try to defuse the international crisis over the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi.Jared Kushner helped build the alliance between the House of Saud and the House of Trump. The president’s son-in-law and senior adviser took the lead in promotingMohammed bin Salmanas a Saudi visionary, and persuaded the administration to hitch US Middle East policy to the prince’s rising star.Together the two thirty-something princelings, MBS and Kushner, stayed up late into the night planning to remake the map of the Middle East with bold thinking and mountains of cash. For now, however, those plans are stalled. The Saudi crown prince stands accused of masterminding the cold-blooded murder of a dissident journalist, Kushner is silent and Donald Trump has been performing crisis public relations for the Saudi monarchy.Jamal Khashoggi: US secretary of state arrives in Saudi Arabia for crisis talksRead morePeppered with questions on Monday, the president gamely suggesting that the suspected hit team that arrived in Istanbul on official jets and had free run of the Saudi consulate there, were “rogue killers” acting without the knowledge of the prince or his father, King Salman.Pageantry and promisesThe scramble for alibis is a long way from the high hopes of May last year, when the Trump–Saud courtship was consummated. The new president made Riyadh the destination of his first trip abroad since taking office. In the months before, Kushner identified MBS as a potential partner. The state department and the CIA backed Mohammed bin Nayef, the incumbent crown prince at the time, but the first son-in-law insisted that he had “reliable intelligence” – most likely from the Israeli president, Benjamin Netanyahu, a Kushner family friend – that Mohammed Bin Salman was the man to bet on. The prophecy became self-fulfilling as wholehearted support from Washington aided Mhis rise, eventually eclipsing and replacing Nayef.Meanwhile, theRiyadh summitappeared to be a glittering success. Trump was flattered and feted, given a sword with which to dance in step with King Salman and his retinue. There was a flypast of nine warplanes, the most the Saudis had ever attempted, and horses alongside the limos.The pageantry was backed up with substance.King Salmanhad gathered other Gulf Arab leaders in Riyadh to promise to fight terrorism and Iran, which both the hosts and their US guests viewed pretty much as one and the same.FacebookTwitterPinterestMike Pompeo (centre) greets Saudi officials on his arrival in Riyadh on Tuesday. Photograph: Leah Millis/APIn Riyadh, Trump also claimed that he had managed to sell the Saudis $110bn (£83bn) in US-made weapons. The president cited the figure again last week to explain why he could not afford to impose sanctions on the Saudi royal family even if they were found to have murdered Khashoggi, but it waslargely illusory. It included deals agreed under the Obama administration and some statements of intent to buy some weapons systems, but no actual new contracts.However, arms sales were just part of the bonanza MBS promised Trump. When thecrownprince made a three-week tour of the US in Marchthis year, he made a point of visiting the titans of US tech industries on the west coast. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), pledged $45bn to the Japanese group SoftBank towards its planned $100bn technology venture capital fund.PIF also bought a $3.5bn share in the ride-sharing company Uber; a $2bn stake in the electric carmaker Tesla; and put about $1bn in Virgin Group’s space companies.US and Saudi economies entwinedIt was a statement of intent. The nation built on oil wealth was buying a stake in a low-carbon future. As part of the crown prince’s Saudi Vision 2030, a futuristic megacity called Neom would rise from the sands, run by artificial intelligence and serviced by robots. It would be a huge potential market for Silicon Valley.As the US and Saudi economies became ever more intertwined, their foreign policies lined up in parallel. The Obama administration had sought to balanceSaudi Arabiaand Iran but Trump would be all in alongside Riyadh against Tehran. And the Saudis would back Kushner’s big project, a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.When Congress raised doubts about the kingdom’s worsening human rights record, as Bin Salman crushed dissent inside Saudi Arabia andlocked up his princely rivals in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, or about the terrible civilian deaths from the Saudi-led coalition’s aerial bombing campaign in Yemen, there was lots of lobbying money to smooth the way.According to the Centre for International Policy, theSaudis spent $27mon Washington lobbying firms in 2017, three times what they spent in 2016. Of that, $400,000 went straight to the campaign funds of senators and House members who were urged to turn a blind eye to Saudi excesses.In the end, it was not the mass crackdown on dissent that slowed the Trump-Saud locomotive in its tracks, nor the deaths of thousands of civilians in Yemen. Not even the death of 40 Yemeni boys on a school outing, killed by aUS-made, Saudi-dropped bombin August, caused much of a ripple in the bilateral relationship.Saudi summit in crisis as Khashoggi case prompts mass withdrawalsRead moreThe disappearance and suspected murder of one man has done more to jeopardise US-Saudi relations than three years of bombing and blockades in Yemen. Khashoggi is a US resident and a contributor to the Washington Post, whose owner, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was one of the west coast moguls MBS schmoozed in March.As the Saudi government has flailed in response to damning Turkish leaks about Khashoggi’s reported murder and dismemberment, lashing out at its critics and putting up a wall of denial, the procession of western businesses cutting their ties with Riyadh has become a stampede.FacebookTwitterPinterestJared Kushner, White House adviser and President Trump’s son-in-law, at the Saudi royal court in Riyadh. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersOne tech and media company after another hassent its regretsto the Future Investment Initiative conference, the flagship of Bin Salman’s westernising aspirations known as “Davos in the desert”.The Saudi regime’s staunchest remaining friend in the west is theTrump administration. As of Tuesday, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was still planning to attend the Riyadh conference. But Trump’s loyalty to the Saudi royals is stretching his credibility to breaking point even with the Republican faithful in Congress.Discontent in the senateA bipartisan list of 22 senators have asked the US to carry out an investigation of what happened to Khashoggi and report back in 120 days with a decision on whether to impose sanctions on those responsible. The Senate can be expected to be sceptical about claims that “rogue killers’ were responsible.Meanwhile, senators from both parties wrote last week to Pompeo challenging his argument for continuing to certify arms exports to Saudi Arabia and asking that he return to Congress by the end of the month to shore up his case.Even if the Senate does vote against arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Trump could tough it out and overrule congressional disapproval with a veto. But it would mark a major rift between the president and his party.Gerald Feierstein, a former US diplomat who was principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near-eastern affairs in the Obama administration, said: “The Senate might not stop arms sales but the symbolism of a vote of disapproval would be significant and could influence the administration to change direction.”Few expect the House of Saud to fall over the Khashoggi affair, but the grander ambitions promoted by Bin Salman have visibly sagged and could collapse, taking with it a lot of the House of Trump’s remaining lustre.TopicsUS foreign policySaudi ArabiaJamal KhashoggiArms tradeMohammed bin SalmanMiddle East and North AfricaanalysisShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/16/jared-kushner-trump-saudi-khashoggi-mbs,Julian Borger,"

"
"n the wake of Roseanne’s cancelation last May, following racist tweets sent out by star and producerRoseanne Barr, many observers took to the site of her downfall to joke about looking forward to the show’s eventual return under the new title Dan.Those jokes proved to be pretty on-the-money, although the latest iteration of the series is called The Conners. It brings the rest of its cast back intact – John Goodman as the gruff-but-loving patriarch Dan; recent Oscar-nomineeLaurie Metcalfas aloof Aunt Jackie; Sara Gilbert and Lecy Goranson as night-and-day sisters Darlene and Becky; Michael Fishman as the constantly ignored DJ; and the various newcomers and guest stars (including Johnny Galecki, Juliette Lewis and Mary Steenburgen) that make up their various kids, partners, exes, friends, neighbors and co-workers – as well as its trademark brand of character-driven humor suffused with working-class melancholy. It also retains its interest in issue-driven storylines (the two episodes screened early for critics, one and four, deal with addiction, sex, sexual orientation, healthcare and job security), while this time avoiding any explicit mention of current controversies and figures (ie there’s no mention of Trump).Love after life: how TV imagines relationships beyond the graveRead moreOf course, the main questions surrounding The Conners isn’t what’s in them, but rather, what’s missing from them.First and foremost, while Roseanne Barr may be gone, Roseanne Conner isn’t. The show picks up on a number of plot points left dangling from the truncated 10th season – a couple of which now come off as extremely serendipitous – and without going into the details surrounding her character’s fate (as per studio mandate), those who watched probably have a pretty good idea as to how things play out (though, to its credit, the show throws in a reveal that muddies the waters and makes for good drama). Roseanne’s absence isn’t a logistical hurdle, but the focus; not only of the premiere but, judging by the other episode I saw, the season as a whole.FacebookTwitterPinterestWhile it seemed unlikely The Conners would write off its main character and move on without looking back, it’s not as if other long-running shows haven’t done exactly that (see Two and a Half Men – or, rather, don’t). Given the charged political nature of Barr’s dismissal, there surely must have been those behind the scenes advocating for the series to get any mention to her out of the way as quickly and succinctly as possible. It is a sitcom, after all; if it can make people laugh, it may well make them forget. That the show has chosen not to do such speaks to its strengths as a cultural institution, as well as its faith in the cast.When it comes to the latter, that faith is mostly well-founded. Political and personal viewpoints aside, Barr’s time away from the camera was highly noticeable last season in her muggy performance and stilted line delivery. Goodman, arguably our most consistent character actor of the last several decades, has no such problem. His acumen at drama proves especially essential, as the new series is constantly taking turns in heavy territory. Goodman makes it possible to forget that you’re watching a three-camera sitcom reboot (of a reboot) mired in annoying controversy and invest purely in his three-dimensional portrayal of a man forced to deal with a sudden load of emotional strain.FacebookTwitterPinterestJohn Goodman and Laurie Metcalf in The Conners. Photograph: Eric McCandless/ABCThe same can be said of Metcalf, who is given a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to the dramatic scenes, although for the most part her character remains the high-energy doofus she’s always been. Gilbert also proves surprisingly adept at switching between drama and comedy (not to sell her previous work short, but she’s had less opportunity to show off her chops over the years). She has the hardest job of anyone in the case, moving as she does into the lead role, even as her characters takes up the mantle as the acid-tongued, steel-spined matriarch of the family.Despite The Conners’ mature handling of Roseanne’s departure and the gameness of its lead cast, the rest of the show proves to be a standard sitcom in every way. The jokes are half-clever, with one in 10 truly landing. That seems unlikely to drive away fans, though, indistinguishable as it is from what they’re used to by this point.As far as the chances of the show’s broader success, that’s harder to predict. Those who came to Roseanne specifically for the title character and/or Barr’s singular comic persona will definitely feel her absence, while her political partisans seem unlikely to return in the first place, let alone give it a fair shake if they do (especially now that, without Barr serving as a counterbalance, the show’s liberal bent is far more prevalent). But to those who found the larger family dynamics and humor of the show engaging, and for who Roseanne herself isn’t a deal breaker, The Conners is offers as dignified and consistent a transition as could reasonably be expected.That smoothness does, however, signify the lack of an edge, the same which Roseanne brought to it even before her rightwing conversion and public disgrace. Whether or not The Conners can sustain itself without that edge remains to be seen.The Conners starts on ABC on Tuesdays with a UK network yet to be announcedTopicsUS televisionRoseanne BarrLaurie MetcalfJohn GoodmanTelevisionTV comedyfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/16/the-conners-roseanne-without-roseanne-barr,Zach Vasquez,"

"Daisy Johnson, the youngest author ever to make theMan Booker prizeshortlist, is proving the most popular with readers with just hours to go before the judges unveil the winner of this year’s £50,000 prize on Tuesday evening.As the judging panel, chaired by Kwame Anthony Appiah, settle in to find a winner from the six titles they picked for their shortlist, 27-year-old British author Johnson’s first novel Everything Under also overtook former favourite Richard Powers at the bookies. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said that while the American literary heavyweight had been the long-term favourite to win this year’s Booker with his environmental novel The Overstory, “money is coming for Daisy Johnson in the 11th hour to cause an upset”. Johnson was given odds by Ladbrokes of 9/4 to win, while Powers sat at 5/2.Play Video0:30Daisy Johnson tipped to be youngest Man Booker prize winner - videoDaisy Johnson and Michael Hughes on Classical adaptation - booksRead moreEverything Under, a reimagining of Greek myth that tells the story of a difficult mother-daughter relationship in modern Britain, is also the bestselling book on the shortlist: it has sold more than 5,200 copies to date, according to Nielsen BookScan, around 400 copies more than the second bestselling title on the shortlist, Northern Irish author Anna Burns’s take on the Troubles, Milkman.“Milkman has had the head start in terms of paperback sales and is currently our bestseller. However, Everything Under has enjoyed the most significant uplift in sales since the shortlist was announced. This would be a very strong winner for us, and a very well-deserved one too,” said Waterstones’ Bea Carvalho. “This stunning debut would be an impressive offering from any well-established author. She has a rare talent and I’m really excited to see what she produces next.”The two US authors on the shortlist, Powers and Rachel Kushner, have both sold around 4,200 copies, with Canadian Esi Edugyan’s Washington Black selling 3,720 copies to date, and Scottish writer Robin Robertson’s novel in verse, The Long Take, racking up sales of around 2,500 copies.According to Ladbrokes, Edugyan’s novel about an 11-year-old slave on a Barbados sugar plantation is third most likely to win this year’s Booker: it has given Edugyan odds of 7/2, ahead of Robertson at 5/1, Burns at 6/1, and Kushner’s The Mars Room at 7/1.“All six are very worthy winners,” said Carvalho at Waterstones. “My personal favourite, if I had to choose, would be Washington Black: it’s a thoughtful, profound epic that feels destined to become a future classic. Esi Edugyan shines an uncomfortable light on some of the very worst aspects of mankind, while also managing to celebrate friendship, resilience, the beauty of the natural world, and love. It’s a masterpiece which is full of surprises, and is that rare book that should appeal to every kind of reader.”TopicsMan Booker prize 2018Man Booker prizeFictionAwards and prizesnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/16/man-booker-prize-daisy-johnson-tipped-to-be-youngest-ever-winner,Alison Flood,"

"he photograph makes me squirm. Four young women, cling-wrapped in awkward swimsuits and perched on high heels, stand on display. One smirks, the other three look unsure. They clutch their competition numbers and present their naked white legs for consideration by the unseen judges.Behind the stage, a crowd of mostly women and children cluster around the elevated stage, their faces resigned or perplexed. Dotted among the crowd, a few white men stare blankly, appraising the women’s bodies, while the only black man frowns. Most people seem bemused by the uncomfortable spectacle taking place in their local supermarket. Outside the frame, shoppers push their trolleys through the aisles, taking toilet paper and bread rolls and washing powder off the shelves.David Goldblatt and the everyday reality of South African racism – in picturesRead moreIt makes me shudder because David Goldblatt took the photograph “Saturday Morning at the Hypermarket: Miss Lovely Legs Competition” at the supermarket where my mother shopped when I was a child growing up inSouth Africa. And if my seven-year-old self wasn’t there on that day in 1980, I probably was later that week.In itself, the image is ordinary. Like many of Goldblatt’s photographs, it isn’t dramatic, the subjects unknown. But it shows the casualness of a society separated by apartheid. It captures the uneasiness that pulsed through my childhood growing up in South Africa. It recalls things I saw but did not see. And it drags up the old questions that lurk beneath my memories – how could such ordinariness take place while countless horrors were happening off camera?FacebookTwitterPinterestDavid Goldblatt’s Woman with Pierced Ear, Joubert Park, Johannesburg, from his Particulars series. Photograph: David Goldblatt/Museum of Contemporary Art AustraliaThe image will be among many in the exhibitionDavid Goldblatt: Photographs 1948–2018at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art over the summer. The vast exhibition, which was planned and curated before the late South African photographerdied in June this year, will include his earliest work, his later portraits of miners, of Afrikaners, of exhausted early morning commuters and those affected by Aids, as well as his numerous landscapes of meaning-laden buildings and the lumbering mines that built the fortunes of the white ruling class thanks to black labourers. Most are in black and white – Goldblatt famously said “Colour was too sweet for apartheid” – and capture seven decades of a country and people divided by racism.Goldblatt didn’t see himself as an artist. As he told the Australian’sTim Douglasin his last interview: “I am a photographer. I don’t hold exhibitions to glorify my artistic skill. These things I capture in my work are real. I photograph things that are important to me and to ­society. I want the pictures to be seen, because I want the message to be heard. But I’m not in the slightest bit interested in art and the glorification of art for art’s sake. It means nothing to me. I couldn’t give a fuck.”Instead he saw himself as a documentarian. When asked, he explained the purpose of his photographs tohis friend and colleague Paul Weinberg: “I was asking myself how it was possible to be so apparently normal, moral, upright – which almost all those citizens were – in such an appallingly abnormal, immoral, bizarre situation. I hoped we would see ourselves revealed by a mirror held up to ourselves.”And this is what I ask when I look at his images. As Susan Sontag wrote in her essayOn Photography, “The ultimate wisdom of the photographic image is to say: ‘There is the surface. Now think – or rather feel, intuit – what is beyond it, what the reality must be like if it looks this way.’” As I study the faces, the familiar landmarks and everyday scenes, I search for their meaning, trying, like Goldblatt, to understand. The series Particulars, where Goldblatt captures close-ups of a subject’s hands, their knees, their ears, stands out for me. As I look at them, I imagine him asking: “Where in the body does hate live? Where does love live?”There is no violence in Goldblatt’s photograph –no schoolchildren fleeing police gunfireon the Soweto streets; nobodies strewn on the ground after the Sharpeville massacre. Just everyday life. Goldblatt wasn’t interested in those sort of images; he described himselfas a coward who would “run away from violence”FacebookTwitterPinterestDavid Goldblatt’s photograph ‘Here on his bed in 2007 Ellen Pakkies strangled her son Abie’. Photograph: David Goldblatt/Museum of Contemporary Art AustraliaBut violence permeates every life in South Africa and fear is a constant. The closest he came to examining this unavoidable reality is a series entitledEx offenders, also part of the MCA exhibition. For this series, he photographed those who have committed a serious crime at the location where the event took place. Black and white, men and women are photographed, their wrongdoing described plainly. There’s “Blitz Maaneveld at the Terrace, Woodstock, Cape Town, where he murdered a man with whom he had been gambling”. There’s “Hennie Gerber where he tortured and then murdered Samuel Kganakga, Heriotdale, Johannesburg”. Here’s Ellen Pakkies [who] “strangled her son Abie, after his need for money to feed his drug addiction had led to him robbing the household of everything saleable for so long that she could no longer bear the strain. Lavender Hill, Cape Town.”The Birmingham Project: behind Dawoud Bey's haunting portraitsRead moreLike all South Africans, my family experienced violent crime: my only uncle was murdered in a burglary gone wrong, a 16-year-old neighbour raped and murdered, our home burgled three times. None of these crimes made the headlines, none were exceptional – in fact we would be considered relatively fortunate. But as I stare at the faces in this series, I feel the same old prickling of fear – and the same need to understand. These are the people that committed the terrors that haunt me and they look so ordinary. Like many in South Africa, they aren’t monsters; they’re just people who did appalling things.I haven’t been back to South Africa for more than 20 years. The country has moved on in vast leaps but, in my mind’s eye, much of it is frozen in its horribleness, its racism, its misogyny, just like one of Goldblatt’s pictures.But the photographs are also a powerful reminder that while ordinary people went about their daily lives, atrocities were committed and excused in their name. They are a warning that awful things happen on a normal day.David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948-2018 exhibitionwill be on at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art Australia from 19 October 2018 to 3 March 2019TopicsPhotographyExhibitionsSouth AfricafeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/16/david-goldblatts-photographs-documenting-the-casual-horror-of-apartheid-south-africa,Alexandra Spring,"

"By 2013, Sylvester Stallone was out of the late-career Hollywood doldrums. He had resurrected his two most famous characters, Rocky and Rambo, to much acclaim. He had created a hit franchise with The Expendables. And he was about to start talks with Ryan Coogler to makeCreed, which went on to net him an Oscar nomination.But still Stallone wanted more. The clarion call was sounding, and he could ignore it no longer. It was time to accept his destiny. It was time for him to design a fountain pen.This is why, in 2013, Sylvester Stallone teamed up with the 106-year-old Italian luxury brand Montegrappa to create the Montegrappa Chaos Limited Edition. But a pen like this, inspired by 16th-century artists such as Battista Franco and Sebald Beham, couldn’t simply just be put on sale. No, a pen like this needed a trailer. The trailer, which has just resurfaced on social media, it is easily the most ostentatious projectSylvester Stallonehas been involved with. It deserves to be deconstructed.FacebookTwitterPinterestThe trailer begins with some simple narration from Stallone, who meditates on the paradoxes of existence. “To have light, there must first be darkness,” he intones. “Death does not exist without life. To have peace, war is required. He doesn’t say, “To have normal pens, you must also have legitimately batshit pens,” but this sentiment is heavily implied.FacebookTwitterPinterestHe continues: “To keep order, first there must be CHAOS.” Because Chaos is the name of the pen. Because everyone wants a pen called Chaos, don’t they? Nobody wants a pen called Sensible or Reliable or Doesn’t Spunk Ink Everywhere. No, they want Chaos, and Chaos is what Sylvester Stallone has designed. Just how chaotic is it? Glad you asked.FacebookTwitterPinterestThe trailer begins proper. We meet a skeleton, decaying by the banks of the river. Who does the skeleton belong to? The guy who commissioned the pen? We may never know, because it starts to shimmer and glow before us.FacebookTwitterPinterestAnd now it transforms into a mighty monolith. You guessed it, the monolith is the pen. The pen has a skull on it. CHAOS.FacebookTwitterPinterestWait, but that’s not it. A snake emerges from the river and crawls up the pen. Because it is a pen that apparently also has a snake on it. CHAOS.FacebookTwitterPinterestAnd a pirate’s sword, too, lazily flung at it from god knows where. But it’s OK. Everything initially comes from constituent parts, so I’m sure they’ll eventually blend together to form something tasteful and …FacebookTwitterPinterestNope. For some reason, the pen is even more bizarrely gaudy in the flesh than everything that came before it would suggest. It looks like something you’d buy from a French market stall on a school holiday. It looks like a moron’s belt buckle. It is by far the ugliest thing I have ever seen, and I once saw Sylvester Stallone’s Get Carter remake.FacebookTwitterPinterestIt’s worth pointing out that this trailer is almost four minutes long, and this screenshot is only 98 seconds in. The rest of it is all just whooshy CGI closeups that looked as if they’re from the mid-90s, accompanied by the first words anyone could think of. Here, as you can see, it says “EXOTIC”. The next two are “MAJESTIC” and “IMPOSING”.FacebookTwitterPinterestAlso there is quality and beauty in every detail. One such detail, for example, is a fist. This pen has got a little metal fist on it, along with all the other tat that makes it look about as comfortable to hold as a knotty poo. Sylvester Stallone made this.FacebookTwitterPinterestI’ll save the big end reveal as a surprise for you, because I’m still reeling from it. Instead, I’ll end here, at 2 min, 17 sec, where the pen trailer promises to give you “The Power of the Written Word in Your Hands”, which is a description of every pen that has ever been made. Still, the Montegrappa Chaos Limited Edition Fountain Pen in gold is yours fora mere £40,500. Or, if you’re some sort of cheapskate, the silver one is £3,555.TopicsSylvester StalloneStationeryLuxury goods sectorShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/16/sylvester-stallones-chaos-pen-trailer-the-most-bizarre-film-hes-ever-made,Stuart Heritage,"

"Backstage at Melbourne’s Arts Centre, patrons line up, receive a headset and one-by-one are ushered into a hushed area that resembles a library carrel.Once there, we sit at our own desk, put on headphones and watch characters in a rotating miniature diorama tell the story of a voyage across Europe.Behrouz Boochani to Richard Flanagan: the writers pushing for revolution in Australia's refugee crisisRead moreFlight, based on the novel Hinterland by Caroline Brothers, tells what is now a familiar story: the journey of two orphaned Afghan brothers, fleeing the war-torn Middle East for the UK.The boys have an uncle in London, and they want to go to school. Their route is repeated throughout the play as a kind of prayer or incantation: “KabulTehranIstanbulAthensRomeParisLondon!”Terrible and occasionally wonderful things happen to the boys along the way. But for the main, their journey, which takes two years, is perilous. They are forced into farm labour, assaulted, arrested and they endure terrible hunger.Chillingly, this story is still ongoing; right now across Europe there may be thousands of unaccompanied children undergoing the same flight.FacebookTwitterPinterestFlight by Vox Motus, an adaptation of Hinterland by Caroline Brothers, is showing at Melbourne festival. Photograph: Drew FarrellInstead of actors telling the story from a stage, the characters of two orphaned Afghan boys are moulded into clay figurines and placed in scenes that flick past like the pages of a graphic novel, or as if from an old-fashioned Viewfinder. We hear their story via our headsets, with impressive sound design perfectly timed with the revolving images.Scotland’sVox Motus told Fairfaxthat they chose the unusual storytelling method because they feared issue fatigue. As they were planning to adapt Hinterland, the refugee crisis in Europe was dominating the news cycle.“We could have gone and made another show,” says director Candice Edmunds, “but we didn’t want to tell a different story.”The type of storytelling they arrived at has an old-fashioned, almost childlike aspect to it: it’s like being a kid and taken by your parents to see the annual Christmas window display.But this is an asylum storyline, so there’s pain, brutality and horror in the young brothers’ journey. There is something unsettling about seeing the camps at Calais, and the inside of a refrigerated truck taking asylum seekers across the border, rendered in miniature clay.But during the more devastating sequences, I was grateful for the privacy of the carrel: it was difficult to emerge from the performance (if you can call it that – it has more in common with an art installation) with dry eyes. And as an audience of one, seeing the characters up close adds an additional emotional punch to the journey we have seen repeated many times, and which – like the carousel itself – continues on loop.FacebookTwitterPinterestFire Gardens transformed the botanical gardens into a dreamscape. Photograph: Regina MarcenkieneFlight is apiece with this year’s Melbourne festival program, which is marked by risk and innovation.Frogman(by Curious Directive) also used new technologies to tell the story of a girl missing in 1990s Queensland. Audiences were given 3D glasses and switched between a performance on stage set in the presence, and 1995 in virtual reality.One Infinity– a virtuoso piece of dance by choreographer Gideon Obarzanek which runs until 20 October – is innovative in an entirely different way, combining ancient Chinese instruments with audience participation.The festival’s centrepiece was Fire Gardens by French company Compagnie Carabosse, which also used old techniques to stun. On for four nights only, the event transformed Melbourne’s botanical gardens into a dreamscape lit by fire and music. Patrons were only meant to be in the gardens to see the fires for an hour but many lingered longer.

"ontinuing her run of sublime cover versions (there have been two albums of them), the second single from Chan Marshall AKACat Power’s new album,Wanderer, is a subtle, reworked version of Rihanna’s Stay. Marshall first heard the song in an ex-boyfriend’s car, but it was a few years later when she became attached to it – once performing it16 times during a karaoke sessionCat Power is far from the first to pay homage to the woman responsible for one of the best pop songs ever (that would beUmbrella), with Stay being one of the most popular choices.FacebookTwitterPinterestCat Power: Stay – videoHere’s a run down of the best, quirkiest and most unexpectedRihannacovers, in ascending order of greatness.14. Work (Ariana Grande)FacebookTwitterPinterestAriana Grande: Work (Rihanna cover) – videoOK, so this isn’t a real cover – it was part ofGrande’s superb impressions skit when she hosted SNL. But I am including it because it still makes me laugh. Incidentally, this whole segment proves how talented Grande is, both in singing and comedy. Prepare to be amazed at her Shakira impression in particular. Watch the whole thinghere13. Diamonds (Zola Jesus)FacebookTwitterPinterestZola Jesus: Diamonds (Rihanna cover) – videoYes, this does sound likeZola Jesusjust going off on one with a drum machine in her bedroom but somehow it works. The vibe is very much: Let’s have fun with this and bang it up on SoundCloud. Jesus almost bellows the chorus like she’s trashed, but that – and the almost cartoon reverb at the end – comes off as kind of endearing, rather than awful.12. FourFiveSeconds (One Direction)FacebookTwitterPinterestOne Direction: FourFiveSeconds (Rihanna cover) – videoIf you’re going to cover a Rihanna song, then pickingthe one with Paul McCartney and Kanye Westis a ballsy move. But that’s the oneOne Directionplumped for. Debatable whether Louis should have had his mic switched on, but ’twas ever thus.11. Diamonds (Metallica)FacebookTwitterPinterestMetallica: Diamonds (Rihanna cover) – videoAfter professing their love for Beyoncé (“How can you not like Beyoncé?”),Metallicaprove themselves Rihanna fans. “We played a show with her … She was awesome. A lot of energy, great band”, says Lars Ulrich, before the band sing along to Diamonds during a segment of Apple’s Carpool Karaoke.10. Stay (Thirty Seconds to Mars)FacebookTwitterPinterestThirty Seconds to Mars: Stay (Rihanna cover) – videoJared Letooften sounds as if he’s singing through congested sinuses, but here there is enough of a Pixies edge to his vocals to make it work. It’s the rendition that your high-school boyfriend would play, pulling up on a motorcycle with a ghetto blaster secured to the back, before removing his Aviators, kissing you and breaking your heart six months down the line.9. Love on the Brain (MØ)FacebookTwitterPinterestMØ: Love on the Brain (Rihanna cover) – videoTheDanish singerabsolutely smashes a rendition of the doo-wop-inspired Love on the Brain during a session on the BBC’s Live Lounge. Apart from the final note, but let’s not dwell too much on that when the rest of it work, work, work, work, work works.8. SOS (The Last Shadow Puppets)FacebookTwitterPinterestThe Last Shadow Puppets: SOS (Rihanna cover) – videoCan’t say SOS is the best Rihanna cut (my favourite thing about it is that it knockedDaniel Powter’s Bad Dayoff the top of the charts), but Alex Turner and Miles Kane transformed it into three minutes of unhinged, vampiric synth-saturation during a Radio 1 Live Lounge outing. The Tainted Love sample here is in the vein of theMarilyn Manson versionrather than Soft Cell’s original. As with all the best cross-gender covers, the lyrics aren’t changed.7. Kiss It Better (Miguel)FacebookTwitterPinterestMiguel: Kiss It Better (Rihanna cover) – videoCrowds at SXSW in 2016 got treated to a sexy version of Kiss It Better byMiguel. They did have to help out a lot, directed in a call-and-response chorus. It wasn’t great that Miguel got out his phone in the middle of it and started recording himself. But, hey, it’s Instagram’s world now, and we’re all just living in it.6. Man Down (Leona Lewis)FacebookTwitterPinterestLeona Lewis: Man Down (Rihanna cover) – videoMan Down is a reggae song from the albumLoud, with a protagonist who shoots, well, a man down (“in Central Station / In front of a big ol’ crowd”).Lewisreworked her hitBetter in Timewith ragga elements before slipping into a rendition of Man Down on a number of live session performances around 2011, and it hits the spot.5. Wild Thoughts (Harry Styles)FacebookTwitterPinterestHarry Styles: Wild Thoughts (Rihanna cover) – videoTechnically this is a DJ Khaledfeaturing Rihannasong, but I’m including it. Following the blueprint of his solo debut album,Styleschanges Wild Thoughts into a 70s prog-rockish number. Disappointingly, he does not attempt the rap.4. We Found Love (Coldplay)FacebookTwitterPinterestColdplay: We Found Love (Rihanna cover) – videoI should start by saying nothing can top the original. ButColdplaygo full Coldplay here, and, though Chris Martin is unsuited to the vocal, the piano intermissions add a different mood. A box drum is involved and it’s a shambles, but a cute one. It also very much sounds as if they listened back to this and then wroteSky Full of Stars3. Diamonds (Sia)FacebookTwitterPinterestSia: Diamonds (Rihanna cover) – videoThere’s a very simple reasonSiadoes such a great job on Diamonds, and that’s because she wrote the song (in just 14 minutes). There’s anacoustic versionout there and an evenearlier sketch, but proper, fleshed-out, choreographed performances have featured in recent shows. In many ways, I think this could have done just as well as Rihanna’s version, but it was written at a time (2012) when Sia was very firm on her wish to be out of the spotlight, and producers Benny Blanco and StarGate had been specifically tasked with creating a song for Rihanna.2. Love on the Brain (Kelly Clarkson)Kelly Clarkson: Love on the Brain (Rihanna cover) – videoOne of the highlights of Rihanna’s 2016 albumAnti, Love on the Brain suitsClarkson’s voice – always one of the best in pop – perfectly. Even better, it seems Clarkson just knocked this out during a quiet moment in the studio.Rihanna: Growing up in Barbados, school was a grind. But I was luckyRead moreCat Power: 'I didn’t know I loved myself when I was younger'Read more1. Stay (Patti Smith)FacebookTwitterPinterestPatti Smith: Stay (Rihanna cover) – videoYou might not ordinarily putPatti Smithand Rihanna together, but this is precisely the sort of juxtaposition that often results in the best covers. Smith’s rendition at New York’s Webster Hall works surprisingly well, her lower register adding a jagged edge toMikky Ekko’s piano melody. Even when Smith messes up (“Oh no! I’m sorry, I’m just nervous … I was doing it so good, too!”) it only speaks to her love of the song. “Rihanna!” she shouts at the end, grinning from ear to ear, like a proper fan.This article was amended on 16 October 2018 to correct the nationality of Mø. She is Danish, not Swedish as an earlier version said.TopicsRihannaR&BCat PowerPatti SmithKelly ClarksonSia FurlerfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/16/rihanna-cover-versions-cat-power-coldplay-last-shadow-puppets-harry-styles-patti-smith,Hannah Jane Parkinson,"

"________________________Sean Moxom-WyldePub landlord,30‘I’m brand new to this hobby. On my stag do, a group of us went to a medieval event and watched people re-enacting a fight. Immediately, my brother, who was my best man, said: ‘We need to do this.’ So we found a group that wasn’t too far from where we live and that was it: we were in. You can so easily get engrossed by it, it’s so addictive.‘Being away from modern technology and not having a mobile phone for the weekend is actually quite glorious. It’s bare bones. You don’t need your phone, you don’t need your money and all the luxuries. You look around here, there’s nothing in sight that’s modern and we enjoy it.’________________________Natalie ThompsonBusiness support officer,29‘The kids who come to watch the re-enactment are mostly into the weaponry, but they’re shocked when they come to the living history camps and see so many foods they recognise.‘Usually I cook a stew or a pottage, which is a bit like porridge but with barley instead of oats; sometimes we do meat on the spit, flatbreads or oatcakes. It’s very different to a normal kitchen: you can’t control the temperature and you can’t just walk away. Luckily I have a lot of guys around who can chop the wood for me.’________________________Autumn McKimmSchoolgirl, 10‘It’s amazing and fun and interesting. We learn a lot about the different kinds of swords and weapons they had back then. We do archery on top of a hill and sword fighting.’Autumn’s parents, Lorna and Stuart, add: “This is probably our 10th year coming here. Autumn started as a baby in a basket so it’s kinda strange to see her now, running around like a loon. She used to have an authentic rag doll she’d carry around, because you can’t have modern toys when you’re re-enacting.”________________________Raffi Thomas21‘Today I’m going under the name Ljot Ketil Bjǿrnson. It’s a real name from the period. Ljot means ugly. I chose the name before I knew what it meant. Ketil Bjǿrnson means son of the helmet bear, so actually it’s quite appropriate because I studied history at the University of York and ended up writing my dissertation on Anglo Saxon helmets in poetry.‘Back in 1066, people didn’t really write directly about warfare, they tended to write poetry that told you more how it felt. When you read Anglo Saxon poems, you find their sense of humour and the things they enjoy are very similar to ours today. It’s a window into what life might have been like.‘The Bayeux Tapestry is also a wonderful resource because it shows you what people were wearing at the battle. We think it was stitched by English nuns about 20 years after the battle. It depicts the events leading up to it, and the battle itself, but it very abruptly finishes and we can never really know why. Maybe the money for the tapestry ran out. For a long time, it was just left sitting in a church in a box because people didn’t realise its significance.’________________________David McNicholSecurity guard,43‘I chose to be a slave for the battle. Normally I’m a warrior, but everybody is a warrior or the wife of a warrior, even the craftsmen are all middle class or upper class. So I did a bit of research in the Domesday Book and found out that anywhere up to 10% of the population were slaves – actual human cattle.‘The guys here are the closest friends I’ve got, though we don’t meet up often enough. For some events we get expenses paid, but that’s all. The vast majority of us are here simply for the love of it.’________________________Jane RichardsonDisability learning support practitioner,55‘You don’t need a formal education to learn about history. Probably 90% of us are not formally educated but you just pick it up as you go along. I was teaching someone about the word hostage the other day. It used to mean taking someone into your household and looking after them well, as if they were one of your family – but they’d also be keeping them there for their own security, as a form of ransom.‘I’ve been doing re-enactments since 1985, so it’s really under my skin. I’m the group leader and seeing people come off the battlefield with so much adrenalin – for me, it’s like enjoyment by osmosis.’dividerRe-enactors recreate the Battle of Hastings in front of a huge crowd at the EnglishHeritagesite. All photos by Jonny Weeks for the Guardiandivider________________________Patrick and Romane FornageFather and daughter,30 and two‘We come from Lyon in France, but we wanted to be Saxons for this battle because it doesn’t matter who you are in real life or where you come from, what matters is the thought process and trying be historically accurate in what we recreate. We’re trying to be people of a certain place and a certain time.’Patrick’s partner, Layla Haffer, pictured in the yellow headdress below, adds: ‘We’re not really craftsmen, but we made the stools and the awning and our clothes ourselves. Our group is all about fighting and we also like camping. We like camping historically and the hardship that comes with it. We’re not glamping!’________________________Courtney ClarkRestaurant worker,20‘The main lure of re-enacting is that I get to be myself. In modern life, I’m pinned down by expectations about being a woman and looked upon as weird. As a re-enactor, I fight and play with crossbows. It’s very liberating.‘I normally do medieval re-enactments with my partner. It’s through this that we grew closer and I moved to live in Battle. I can walk to this site to re-enact here.’________________________Dan Shadrake and Kerry BallardHistorian and author,52; satellite engineer,55Dan Shadrack says: ‘I was one of the advisers on Ridley Scott’s film Gladiator. Obviously, one has to compromise when one works on any project like that, because if you saturate it too much with pure history then things don’t flow nicely. On a film set, things have to look good, so for instance, the Roman standards they carry are much bigger and more spectacular than the proper ones.‘We have to admit there are huge gaps in our information and everything we do as re-enactors is an interpretation. We don’t have a time machine. We can’t say ‘it was definitely like this’, all we can say is ‘this is our interpretation’.‘When we’re here for English Heritage, we try to make things as accurate as possible, so everything we’re wearing is accurate for the time. I’m wearing riveted chainmail, the helmets are steel, everything’s padded with sheepskin. The only thing I haven’t done to be totally authentic is take the fillings out of my teeth.‘Doing re-enactment makes you admire and respect the people of that time. We’re 21st-century people with our flabby 21st-century bodies, and here we are trying to emulate 11th-century people. We don’t have the core strength that our ancestors would have had. People in the original battle were tough. And it wasn’t a short battle, it was an all-dayer.’________________________Duncan Richardson56‘My wife describes my hobbies as: hitting people, hitting people, hitting people and hitting people. I used to practise Kendo, Japanese sword-fencing, in a church hall in Gillingham, and one day a big hairy guy said to me: “What’s going on in there then?” When I showed him, he told me he did sword and shield combat. He had long red hair down to his bum, so I said: “What are you then, a Viking?” He said he was, and I’ve been doing re-enactments ever since.‘You get the battlefield buzz when you’re fighting. The fighters in 1066 would definitely have had to get themselves psyched up for near-certain death. Luckily I didn’t die today – I ran away!’________________________Maiken Lykke BagleyExam invigilator,45‘A few years ago, I was in the pile of Saxon re-enactors that die early in the battle. You’re told to die in a pile because otherwise the horses will step on you. You can actually feel the ground moving as they come up, it’s unnerving. You get a tiny smidgen of a feel for what it was like to stand on a real battlefield. You know there’s nothing you can do to stop them.‘In 1066, women were not trained as professional soldiers. Both sides were Christian and a woman’s role was not on the battlefield. As re-enactors there are a lot of women who enjoy taking part, so we adopt male roles and wear warriors’ outfits.‘In the original battle they had about 1,000 archers here, mainly on the Norman side. That’s who I represent today. We’re lobbing the arrows up, shooting into the masses and hoping to hit something. If you look up, it’s dangerous. It’s disputed whether King Harold was hit in the eye with an arrow, but it seems like quite a good story, so that’s what we do every year.’________________________Elidir McKimmSchoolboy, 11‘Sometimes I’m allowed to put on my mum’s helmet and train with a sword and learn “the eights”, where you block and defend and attack.’Elidir is Autumn’s brother. His father, Stuart, says: “When the kids are play-fighting with their swords, it’s quite authentic, because they’re learning to fight like children would have done back then. I got into it when I went to a show as a kid – it was my dream to run away with the Normans.”________________________Johnathen EverettNuclear project engineer,23‘Time Team did a dig here a few years ago and all they found was re-enactors’ lost items, pendants and things. That’s how they found out this wasn’t actually the 1066 battlefield. The roundabout around the corner is where they now reckon the actual battle was. But the abbey was built here to commemorate the battle so everyone thought this must be Senlac Ridge.‘I’ve been doing this 10 years. When I opened a Facebook account, someone I knew from school sent me a message asking if I wanted to hit people with swords? I said, ‘oh alright then.’ I’ve been coming back ever since. We’re all a bit mad playing dress-up in a field. I really enjoy the companionship of it. Before you know it, it’s 4am in the morning and you’re sat around the campfire and everyone’s giggling.’",http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/16/battle-of-hastings-revisited-reenact-1066,Jonny Weeks,

"The sheer magnitude of the famine facingYemenwas initially underestimated by the aid sector, leaving food security experts rushing to update projections made at the UN general assembly a fortnight ago, sources have told the Guardian.The speed at which the Yemeni currency plunged in early September, forcing food prices to soar, is being blamed for miscalculations that mean between 1.5 million and 2 million more people than initially thought are now at risk of famine.Humanitarians warn children will be worst hit in what is being forecast as theworld’s most lethal famine for 100 yearswith up to 14 million people at risk, according to the UN.“The crisis in Yemen is so huge and of such magnitude, we have to be frank about whether we can together deal with what is facing us,” said Lise Grande, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. “We are literally looking at hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people who may not survive.”Britain announced on Tuesday it would provide further aid to tackle malnutrition among Yemen’s children, with funding secured to help screen 2.2 million under-fives.But the news was met with cynicism from one humanitarian organisation, which criticised the UK for providing aid with one hand and arms to the Saudi-led coalition with the other.FacebookTwitterPinterestThe UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, visiting injured children in the northern province of Saada, in August. Photograph: Naif Rahma/ReutersYemen was plunged into civil war in 2015 after Houthi rebels – Shia Muslims backed by Iran – seized control of much of the country, including the capital, Sana’a. A Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign aimed at restoring President Hadi’s government, with support from the US, UK and France.The famine is being driven by economic factors caused by conflict, rather than a lack of food, experts say. The depreciation of the Yemeni currency has caused food prices to increase, while the soaring cost of fuel has made transport more expensive.In addition, importers of basics such as cooking oil, rice, sugar and butter have been prevented from entering the country due to restrictions imposed by Yemen’s central bank based in Aden, territory controlled by its exiled government.“Tens of thousands of destitute families, who were barely able to buy what they needed just a few weeks ago, can no longer afford to feed themselves at all,” Grande told the Guardian.About 8.5 million people in the Middle East’s poorest country alreadyrely on the World Food Programmeto survive, including 1 million who receive cash assistance.But if the current trend continues, as many as 5.6 million more Yemenis may need assistance to survive.Grande said: “Things are deteriorating very, very quickly. The implications of this are enormous, and, truthfully, frightening. The reality is that time may be running out.”The UN’s humanitarian lead, who met with key donors on Monday, said the agency was now scrambling to raise funds for emergency cash assistance.Grande said: “One of the fastest and most effective ways of helping destitute families is to give them cash. This allows them to buy what they need, when they need it. Humanitarians are looking at ways to expand cash programmes as quickly as possible.”Her comments came as a representative from theNorwegian Refugee Councilcriticised Britain for supplying arms to Saudi Arabia.Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen | Patrick WilckenRead moreSuze van Meegen, a protection and advocacy adviser for the council based in Sana’a, said: “I anticipate the calls will come for international government to inject more cash into solving the crisis.“But the crisis doesn’t lie with money. It lies in stopping the war. There is a duplicity in the UK, for example, where the British government is providing a lot of money to help us reach people with aid but it could get more bang for its buck if it just stopped selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.”She said the worst of the violence is concentrated around Hodeidah city. “In the last few months we have seen half a million people flee the region. We are also very concerned about the safety of the port there, which is depended on for 70% of the food and fuel Yemen needs.”Van Meegen said people are already starving to death in “very large numbers”.“From our perspective we may as well consider ourselves already in famine. This time last year we warned that 8.4 million people were already on the brink of famine. The images now speak for themselves.”She added: “There is direct violence but equally we are seeing slow systematic steps by both sides to undermine the economy. It means food is more expensive, it’s double the price it was even a few weeks ago.”Since the offensive on Hodeidahbegan in June, the Norwegian Refugee Council has seen the nature of its work change. Where previously it was trying to help Yemenis through assistance with education and livelihoods, the focus has shifted to survival.Van Meegen said: “Our focus is helping those people who have left home with nothing but a few items in a plastic bag with food and cash. The other thing we are doing is trucking water which is hard to come by and very expensive.”Announcing Tuesday’said packagethe minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said the money would help screen 2.2 million children under the age of five and provide urgent treatment for 70,000 of the most vulnerable youngsters.“The UK is extremely concerned at the deepening humanitarian crisis … Children are suffering the most and are 12 times more likely to die from diseases. Today’s aid package will help identify cases of malnourishment earlier and provide life-saving care for those most in need,” he said.He called on all parties to support the UN special envoy’s peace talks to find a political solution to end the conflict.The Department for International Development said the aid package of £96.5m will fund the UN children’s agency, Unicef, to tackle malnutrition over three years. Some of the funding is from a £170m package announced for Yemen on 3 April.TopicsFamineYemenUnited NationsMiddle East and North AfricaConflict and armsHungernewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/16/enormity-yemen-famine-initially-underestimated,Hannah Summers,"

"Papua New Guineahas reportedly added three Bentleys to its controversial fleet of luxury cars purchased for the upcoming Apec leaders’ summit in November.Papua New Guineans reacted with outrage to the news that the PNG government had bought 40 Maseratis for the summit despite the country struggling with a nationwide polio outbreak, increased rates of tuberculosis and chronic funding shortages for health, education and other services.Opposition MPs called for a nationwide strikeover the purchase, which cost millions of dollars, calling it “blatant fraud”.The anger looks set to continue after the Australian reported the government was also importing three super-luxury Bentley Flying Spurs, each costing more than $230,000.The Australian published an invoice for the three cars made out to the Apec Papua New Guinea co-ordination authority, which put the total cost of the cars at just under $700,000. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the invoice.Calls for nationwide strike after PNG government buys 40 Maseratis for ApecRead moreAccording to the invoice, issued in July, the cars are to be delivered via sea freight in the last week of October in time for the summit, set to be attended by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, and China’s president, Xi Jinping.Sir Mekere Morauta, an opposition MP and former prime minister of PNG, raised questions about the Bentley purchase including whether the cars had been procured using a competitive tender process and whether they were subject to duties and excise.Mekere said the prime minister, Peter O’Neill, and Apec minister Justin Tkatchenko should explain why they have spent so much on Apec “including many wasteful, extravagant items such as luxury cars, at this time of suffering and hardship”.PNG is the poorest country in the Apec group. It was announced in 2013 that it would host its first everApec summitthis year. Since then PNG’s economy has sharply declined and earlier this year the central highlands area was devastated by an earthquake. There has been an outbreak of polio in the country, even though the disease was officially eradicated in PNG in 2000, claiming the life of a young boy.O’Neill has defended the purchase of the Maseratis, saying the cars will all be sold on to the “private sector” in a public tender after the Apec leaders’ meeting next month.Observers were doubtful of the ability of the government to sell 40 Maseratis – which had never been seen in PNG before – for the same price at which they were bought, and in a city with record high rates of carjackings.Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific islands programme, told the Guardian the issue was “frustrating” and “tin-eared”.“Peter O’Neill was saying this is not going to be Apec of largesse, it’s going to be a Pacific-style Apec, it’s going to be modest,” Pryke said. “If it’s going to be modest why don’t you have a fleet of [Toyota] LandCruisers? LandCruisers are the status symbol in PNG as it is and they could easily be recycled into the PNG economy.”The Apec Papua New Guinea co-ordination authority could not immediately be reached for comment.TopicsPapua New GuineaApec summitAsia PacificnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/first-maseratis-now-bentleys-for-apec-in-papua-new-guinea,Kate Lyons,"

"Ministers from tiny island states including Palau, theSolomon Islandsand Kiribati are calling for help over the “devastating” impacts of criminal networks in the fishing industry.Fishermen, unable to work because stocks are so low, are being lured into gun-running and drug trafficking by international organised crime, the nations’ officials told an industry conference in Copenhagen this week.Estimates of the scale of the problem varies, but the black market in marine wildlife including corals and reef fish in south-east Asia and the Pacific alone is worth US $850m (£625m), according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The actual costs of crime in the industry, which includes tax transgressions, human trafficking and other offences, is far greater.A minister fromPalautold the Guardian he believed the nation’s deepening crystal meth crisis was being fuelled by distant water fishing vessels involvement in the trade. In the Caribbean, where the value of fish has decreased due to overfishing, a coastguard spoke of “fishing canoes leaving Jamaica with marijuana and within 24 hours, coming back with weapons”.In Ghana, children are being recruited and exploited as “hard labour” to work in canoes and boats, according to an environmental specialist from the country.“Transnational organised crime in the fishing industry is a serious crime that disregards the rule of law, mocks our sovereignty and depletes our ocean resources,” said Mas Achmad Santosa, a member of the Indonesian taskforce to combat illegal fishing, who was speaking on behalf of Susi Pudjiastuti, the fisheries minister of Indonesia. It remains one of the biggest threats to ocean resources, by harming our environment and undermining human rights, he said.The symposium, backed by the Norwegian ministry of trade, industry and fisheries, the United Nations Development Programme and the UNODC, refers to the developing island nations as “large ocean states” – an important distinction.Gunnar Stølsvik, the policy director of the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs, said that the definition was an “important shift” in the debate. WhileKiribatiitself is tiny – a collection of 33 atolls with a population of 110,00 people – the size of the ocean over which it has rights is the size of continental India. Palau has an area of ocean – or economic exclusion zone (EEZ) – measuring 500,000 sq km, roughly the size of France. The Faroe Islands has a zone the size of continental Italy.Fleming Umlich Sengebau, the fisheries minister of Palau, told the conference: “To most of you, Palau is but a speck in the ocean … a dazzling speck, with pristine waters and coral reefs, but no less a speck.”But, he said: “Our country extends far beyond the stretch of land.”The Western Pacific nation had introduced measures to tackle overfishing, illegal fishing, wildlife poaching and organised crime, including declaring its waters a shark sanctuary and making 80% of its EEZ a marine sanctuary, where no fishing can take place. However, it only had two vessels to patrol its zone and three to patrol state waters.“We still lack the technology and the financial means to fully support our oceans,” he said.Fish dwindle in the traditionally rich waters of Tanzania – in picturesRead more“Because of our close proximity to south-east Asia, we have seen cases from our neighbours of people trafficking and drug smuggling, which is becoming a big problem in Palau. We’ve found drugs coming from fishing vessels … We suspect boats coming from Palau go to meet fishing vessels in open water.“To expect a small country like Palau to address this is impossible. We want the international community to help.”Kiribati, an island which is disappearing under the ocean because of sea-level rise, sits within one of the best tuna fisheries in the world. Revenue from fisheries licences make up 70-80% of its GDP.“Last year, we had more than 200 vessels enter and leave our waters,” said Tetabo Nakara, the fisheries minister of Kiribati. “But we have a limited capacity to monitor those waters.”Harald Nesvik, the Norwegian minister of fisheries, said that nine countries – Norway, Sri Lanka, Palau, Faroe Islands, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Indonesia, Namibia and Ghana – had signed a declaration on the need for international recognition of the problem. He added it was having a “serious effect on the economy, distorts markets, harms the environment and undermines human rights”. Ultimately, Norway wants to see a UN resolution recognising international organised crime in the fishing industry.“This is a first step,” said Nesvik. “For the UN, the first step is to recognise that these things are happening. This is a battle we can’t afford to lose.”The conference was hosted by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade Industry and Fisheries and the Nordic Council of Ministers, and backed by the UNDP and UN Office on Drugs and Crime.TopicsOceansSeascape: the state of our oceansOrganised crimePalauKiribatiAsia PacificSolomon IslandsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/16/drug-trafficking-at-sea-is-devastating-island-states-ministers-say,Karen McVeigh,"

"Efforts to unite the Brazilian left against rightwing presidential frontrunnerJair Bolsonarohave snagged on internal squabbles, making it even harder to close a gap in opinion polls less than two weeks before the runoff election.In Brazil, only the grandest of coalitions can now defeat BolsonaroRead moreThe latest poll, released by Ibope late on Monday, showed that Bolsonaro had a commanding lead overleftist rival Fernando Haddad, with 59% of valid votes against 41% for Haddad.The poll, details of which ran in newspaper Estado de S Paulo on Tuesday, showed Haddad with a higher rate of “rejection” among voters ahead of the 28 October runoff, due in part to dislike of his Workers Party (PT) even among fellow leftists. About 47% of people polled said they would never vote for him, compared with 35% rejecting Bolsonaro.The bad news for Haddad came as efforts to attract the voters of Ciro Gomes, who came third in the first round of voting on 7 October after a center-left campaign on the Democratic Labor party ticket, devolved into a shouting match at a campaign event on Monday night.At a rally in the northeastern state of Ceara, which Gomes won in the first vote, his brother and campaign manager Cid Gomes was called upon to formally endorse Haddad.But Cid Gomes took the opportunity to call for a mea culpa oversprawling graft schemes orchestrated by leaders of the PT. The party’s founder, former presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is doing jail time for a corruption conviction. Videos of the event showed Cid Gomes was met with rowdy boos.“You’re going to lose the election, and it’s your fault,” Cid Gomes shot back. “You morons! Lula is in prison!“Fernando Haddad aims to be Brazil's new Lula – but does anyone know who he is?Read moreThe PT held the presidency for 13 of the last 15 years and Lula remains beloved by many for his social policies, credited with easing the lives of the poor in one of the world’s most unequal countries.Haddad, a former PT mayor of São Paulo, has been unable to distance himself from the disdain many Brazilians harbor for the party’s role in corruption schemes revealed by investigators in recent years.Haddad has struggled to both stand by Lula, whom the PT considers an unjustly convicted political prisoner, and also acknowledge the party’s errors.Bolsonaro, 63, a seven-term congressman who openly defends Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, is pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate and appealing to voters fed up with political corruption and violent crime.TopicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/brazil-infighting-leftists-frontrunner-rightwing-jair-bolsonaro,,"

"Europe’s security is being put at risk by so-called “golden passport” schemes that have allowed states to sell citizenship or residency to potentially “dangerous” individuals, the EU justice commissioner has warned.Věra Jourová described the programmes as “problematic” and “unfair” – echoing the private concerns of Europe’s intelligence agencies, who fear “golden passports” have been exploited by people with enough money to buy access to the UK and Europe.Her comments came as Malta and Cyprus were named ina blacklist of 21 nationsoperating passport schemes that are deemed to pose a high risk of tax evasion. The list was published on Tuesday by the OECD, a leading thinktank, which wants tighter controls. The two EU member states have already sold citizenship to hundreds of individuals from Russia, China and the Middle East.Jourová said making money was being put before security. “I understand that citizenship schemes are favourable for the economy. But this is unfair for the people who cannot afford to buy citizenship. And citizenship is something so, so big and so valuable that citizenship for sale seems for me rather problematic.”She added: “We have legitimate concerns, because if in one country a dangerous person gets citizenship, he gets citizenship for the whole of Europe. Maybe we all have to renegotiate the whole system and the whole competence of Europe. Because there is a contradiction.“Once we have some weak points in the EU, some weak points where it is easy to enter the space, the whole of Europe has a problem.”British intelligence is also known to be deeply unhappy about the schemes. “It is not just a concern for us, it is a concern for everyone,” said a Whitehall source.Jourová is due to issue a report recommending much tighter controls on the schemes by the end of the year. At the moment Brussels has no power to ban them, though that may change.The commissioner said her report would insist on genuine links between a passport buyer and the country whose citizenship they were applying for.Jourová was speaking in a special interview to mark the first anniversary of the death of the anti-corruption journalistDaphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed in a car bomb attack in Malta.The commissioner decried the lack of progress by police in discovering the identity of those who commissioned the killing on 16 October last year. Three men are on trial for planting the bomb, but those who ordered the killing are believed to be still at large and the police investigation is ongoing.“We are now commemorating the anniversary of the murder and still the results are not here,” said Jourová. “Now, after one year, I am becoming impatient.”Jourová described the killing as a “game changer”, adding: “We know what role the journalists have to play, if they stop we will go to hell.”Her comments come as the Guardian publishes an investigation raising new questions about the influence of a leading player in the “golden passports” industry, Henley & Partners, in the Caribbean states that pioneered such schemes.The investigation is being published under the banner ofThe Daphne Project, a collaboration of 18 news organisations from 15 countries, formed to continue investigations begun by Caruana Galizia.The journalist had raised concerns in her reporting, among other matters, about Henley and its relationship with the government led by Malta’s Labour prime minister, Joseph Muscat.In Malta, an individual can gain citizenship in return for a €650,000 contribution to the country’s development fund and the purchase or lease of property, as well as investments of at least €150,000 in government bonds.Malta’s scheme does not require new citizens to actually spend any time in the properties they purchase or rent in the country. The scheme was designed and is now managed by Henley, which collects commission on every passport sold and has so far made €19m from the contract.Henley says there is a significant societal value created through these programmes, which can encourage foreign investment and boost local GDP. Both Henley and Muscat have consistently defended the use of such schemes, and insist that to prevent abuses taking place, applicants are thoroughly scrutinised beforehand and must undergo stringent due diligence checks against sanctions lists, and records at Interpol and the international criminal court.The investigation focuses on how Henley established its business in the Caribbean and communicated extensively with the now-disgraced British election consultant, Alexander Nix, and his firm SCL.Led by France’sForbidden Stories, the Daphne Project includes the Guardian, Reuters, Switzerland’s Tamedia, Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, and France’s Le Monde.Additional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Arthur Bouvart, Lena Kampf and Jean-Baptiste Chastand.TopicsEuropeThe Daphne ProjectUK security and counter-terrorismDaphne Caruana GaliziaMaltaCaribbeanOECDnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/golden-passports-threaten-european-security-warns-eu-commissioner,"Juliette Garside,Hilary Osborne","

"Theresa Maywill urge EU leaders in Brussels on Wednesday to keep the door open to continuing Brexit negotiations, after a two-and-a-half hour cabinet meeting that underscored the challenge of bridging the gap between London and Brussels in the days ahead.May told her colleagues on Tuesday: “If we as a government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this.”But a string of ministers intervened to stress the importance of time-limiting the Irish backstop and ensuring it did not separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK – both areas where the UK and the EU27 remain at loggerheads.The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, said any Northern Ireland-only arrangements for customs afterBrexitcould mean the province was “torn out of the UK” and leave it “controlled by the EU,” according to one source.No 10 said cabinet members endorsed May’s call to “maintain the integrity of the union” between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which the prime minister told the cabinet was threatened by the EU’s proposedversion of the backstopThe spokesman said the prime minister had told her political colleagues it was “not possible for her or any UK prime minister to sign up to an arrangement that would lead to a customs border down the Irish Sea”.One cabinet minister said: “There was a general wish to get the DUP onside, which hopefully our robust line on the integrity of the UK will help with.”The chief whip, Julian Smith, told ministers that the prime minister would not get House of Commons approval for a backstop that could apply indefinitely.Cabinet Brexiters believe May’s chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, was prepared to sign up to fresh compromises on Sunday, before the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, arrived in Brussels and rejected the latest proposals.Michael Gove reportedly insisted at Tuesday’s meeting that the government must take legal advice on the implications of any fresh backstop text, which will be enshrined in the withdrawal agreement.Complaining that the significance of the backstop had been underplayed by officials in December, Gove told colleagues: “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.” He warned that if the government accepted getting on the, “customs union train,” it would need to know “when to get off”, according to Tory sources.Others insisting on assurances that the UK could not become trapped in a customs union indefinitely included Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, sources said.With May accepting the principle, and no draft text for ministers to scrutinise, there were none of the feared resignations, but the demand for legal advice could limit negotiators’ wriggle room in the days ahead.Drafting a time-limited backstop creates a formidable conundrum for negotiators because the December agreement, signed up to by both sides, said it must operate “unless and until” alternative arrangements that prevent a hard border had been put in place.May’s official spokesman said cabinet members had agreed the UK “cannot be kept in the backstop indefinitely” and ministers had discussed “the need for a mechanism to clearly define how that backstop will end”.Brussels-watchers say any mechanism controlled by the UK would be anathema in Brussels. Mujtaba Rahman, of Eurasia Group, said: “It’s simply inconceivable that the EU will hand the UK the right to exit the backstop at a time of the UK’s choosing.”Quick guideBrexit and backstops: an explainerShowHideA backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal.As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government.That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit.“The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs.Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Cabinet members had beenurged to rise up and rebelagainst the prime minister’s Brexit strategy by the former Brexit secretary David Davis over the weekend.Cabinet members including Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, have privately said the UK should insist on a firm date for ending the backstop.Similar concerns were voiced by Conservative Brexiters in the Commons on Monday, when May updated MPs on the status of the Brexit negotiations, with the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith asking the prime minister: “How long does she think this temporary arrangement might last and, most importantly, who would make the final decision on when it ends?”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free-trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. May has suggested to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate that proposal.As a result, the EU is continuing to insist on having its own backstop, which would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free-trade agreement, prompting fierce objections from Tory hard Brexiters and the Democratic Unionist party, whichprops up her governmentThe shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: “It is simply extraordinary that the cabinet can’t agree what its plan for Brexit is. If the cabinet can’t make a decision on Brexit, then what on earth is the point of it? Theresa May is in office, not in power.”TopicsBrexitTheresa MayConservativesEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policynewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/16/theresa-may-calls-for-unity-after-winning-cabinet-backing-for-brexit-strategy,"Pippa Crerar,Heather Stewart,Dan Sabbagh","

"The Morrison government has promised to legislate a safeguard so no state is left worse off by changes to theGSTdistribution formula for a period of six years.The backdown – announced by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg – responds tostate and territoryconcerns that changes in economic conditions could leave Victoria and New South Wales up to $1bn worse off. There has also been internal dissent federally, including from Tasmanian Liberals.Under the new policy, the government will introduce a goods and services tax floor with the added safeguard that if any state or territory is left worse off in the transition period from 2020-21 to 2026-27, their payments will be restored to the level of the old distribution system.At the end of the transition period the Productivity Commission will review GST distribution again.Frydenberg had previously resisted the push for a safeguard – despite federal Labor and the states’ demands – claiming thatit was unacceptable to set up a “parallel” GST schemefor the states to extract even more money from the commonwealth.The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the treasurer had “buckled to Labor’s pressure”, labelling it a “humiliation” for the Frydenberg and the prime minister, Scott Morrison.However,Bowen had previously signalled that Labor would support legislationfor a GST floor even without the safeguard.On Tuesday Bowen said Labor would be “constructive”, and accepted that it was appropriate to frame the safeguard to “cover a period of time”.Frydenberg said the safeguard would require the commonwealth to “run two sets of books” but described it as a “sensible compromise” to ensure no state or territory would be worse off in the transition period.“I pay credit to my colleagues in the party room who have strongly supported this solution,” he told reporters in Canberra.“The Morrison government is providing a national solution to a national problem – and I’ve have spoken to state treasurers – Liberal and Labor – and they support this way forward as a reasonable, sensible approach.”The Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz thanked Morrison and Frydenberg for the policy change to “ensure the sustainability of Tasmania’s finances for virtually a decade”.In Junethe federal government announced its planto introduce a “floor” so no state receives less than 70% of its own GST revenue from 2022-23, rising to 75% from 2024-25.Over 10 years the policy will cost $9bn, of whichWestern Australia will get $4.7bn, and current estimates suggest that all states and territories will be better off.ButVictorian treasury modelling suggestedthat in a worst-case scenario – depending on certain assumptions about mining production and property taxes – Victoria could lose up to $940m, New South Wales up to $1.1bn and Queensland up to $651m.TopicsGSTJosh FrydenbergAustralian politicsLabor partyCoalitionnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/gst-changes-frydenberg-backs-down-to-guarantee-no-state-will-lose-out,Paul Karp,"

It also remains a threat in parts of neighbouring Kenya.Some observers have questioned the effectiveness of airstrikes by the US and Kenya and raised concerns about civilians being killed.An investigation by the Guardian earlier this yearfound that more than 50 civilians were killed or injured in air strikes in the last six months of 2017.At least two attacks involved US aircraft.The US military maintains that air strikes “reduce al-Shabab’s ability to plot future attacks, disrupt its leadership networks and degrade its freedom of manoeuvre within the region”.In a press release, the US Africa command said the strike on Friday had been carried out in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia,It gave no further details.TopicsSomaliaAl-ShabaabUS militaryAfricanewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/somalia-us-military-airstrike-al-shabaab,Jason Burke,"

"A 39-year-old mentally impaired woman spent 18 months in a Victorian prison locked in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day, screaming with distress for hours on end.The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, described the woman’s case as the saddest she had ever investigated. Ina report tabled to parliament on Tuesday, Glass described the woman’s long and damaging imprisonment at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre west of Melbourne as an “unjust, oppressive, improperly discriminatory and wrong” breach of her human rights.The woman, identified only as Rebecca to protect her privacy, was remanded in custody after being charged with breaching an intervention order taken out by her family in 2015. The order prevented her from going within 200 metres of the family home. Rebecca was also charged with resisting police.She was found unfit to stand trial and not guilty due to mental impairment. Under Victorian law, such people must not be detained in prison unless there is no practicable alternative.Children held in Barwon prison were deprived of their human rights, court findsRead more“She remained in prison simply because there was nowhere for her to go,” Glass wrote. “While Rebecca had a lifelong history of behavioural difficulties, professionals were unable to agree whether she had a mental health condition or a disability. Her changing diagnosis meant she fell into a service gap. Professionals agreed she needed support, but no one could agree on who was responsible.“Her challenging behaviour, which could be antisocial and sometimes violent, brought her into contact with the criminal justice system, and into prison. Despite the care of individual prison officers and staff, her condition deteriorated markedly as a result of her 18 months in solitary confinement. Although valiant efforts are now being made to integrate her into the community, both she and society are still paying a high price.”There is no data on how many people deemed unfit for trial are in prison. But Glass’s report, “Investigation into the imprisonment of a woman found unfit to stand trial”, found Rebecca’s case was not an isolated one.“We heard many more stories, some as sad as Rebecca’s, which highlight both the trauma of incarceration on acutely vulnerable people, and the threat to community safety in failing to provide a safe and therapeutic alternative to prison,” Glass said.“There have been many reviews of secure therapeutic facilities over the years, all of which highlight the acute shortage of beds. Women with disabilities are particularly affected. It is good to see the state government’s recent investment in secure mental health facilities, although as we heard, the recent increase is not for cases like Rebecca’s.”Ombudsman staff conducted a human rights-based inspection of the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, where Rebecca was detained, in July 2017. They found the prison was locking Rebecca in her cell for up to 23 hours a day because she was considered a risk to, and at risk from, other prisoners. They found she was struggling with personal hygiene, including showering, toileting and menstruation, and agencies had been trying to find more suitable accommodation for her for more than a year.She was released from prison in late 2017, after spending more than 18 months in custody.The Victorian government has accepted all eight of Glass’s recommendations, including that it should request the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission review policies and practices for prisoners with mental impairment at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre.The minister for mental health, ageing and disability, Matin Foley, said the government would consider how to “increase access to secure mental health facilities for people with complex needs”. The government had invested $43m in additional 44 beds at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre.TopicsCrime - AustraliaVictoriaMental healthPrisonsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/mentally-ill-prisoner-left-to-scream-for-hours-in-solitary-says-watchdog,Melissa Davey,"

"Some areas have been repainted at the Saudi consulate where missing Saudi journalistJamal Khashoggiwas last seen alive, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said, as investigators prepared to enter the nearby Saudi consul’s house after the diplomat left the country.A tale of two houses: how Jared Kushner fuelled the Trump-Saudi love-inRead moreErdoğan told reporters on Tuesday that police had found evidence of toxic materials and signs that some surfaces had been repainted at the consulate where investigators say the missing journalist was killed.“My hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion as soon as possible, because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,” he said.As police vans pulled up outside the consul general’s residence, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met for crisis talks in Riyadh with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and his father, King Salman.At their afternoon meeting at the Royal Palace, Pompeo and the crown prince exchanged smiles and pleasantries about whether the secretary of state was feeling jetlag. Before reporters were ushered out, the prince said: “We are strong and old allies. We face our challenges together.”“Absolutely,” Pompeo replied.The meeting lasted half an hour but Pompeo and the prince were expected to have a more prolonged session of talks over dinner.The state department did not give an account of the discussions at the meeting but Donald Trump saidon Twitterthat he talked to the crown prince during the meeting and said Bin Salman had “totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate… and told me that he has already started, and will rapidly expand, a full and complete investigation into this matter”.“Answers will be forthcoming shortly,” Trump tweeted.Saudi cooperation is critical to three Trump foreign policy goals: isolating Iran, defeating Islamic State, and being able to claim Arab support for a planned Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.While US media had been reporting that the Saudis were poised to acknowledge that the missing journalist had died as part of a botched rendition attempt, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said on Tuesday that Riyadh had not offered any explanation toTurkeyregarding Khashoggi’s disappearance.Pompeo will meet Çavuşoğlu on Wednesday in Turkey, where a joint Turkish-Saudi investigation is under way.Last week, Trump threatened “severe punishment” if it emerged that Khashoggi had been assassinated.However, the US president said on Monday, without offering evidence, thatKhashoggi could have been murdered by “rogue killers”, prompting speculation that the White House may be willing to protect the House of Saud, a key political and trade ally, from blame for the diplomatic crisis.But Senator Lindsey Graham, an influential Republican ally of Trump, described the crown prince, known by his initials as MBS, as “toxic” and accused him of ordering Khashoggi’s death.“Nothing happens inSaudi Arabiawithout MBS knowing it,” he told Fox News, warning that Congress would “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia” over Khashoggi’s disappearance.Turkish officials continued to leak to news outlets on Tuesday that police found evidence in the nearby consulate building during Monday’s search that proved Khashoggi was killed there. Turkish sources allege the body was then transported to the consul general’s house nearby and disposed of.Of particular interest to the forensics team in the new search is the garden, where it is believed the journalist’s remains could have been buried, and a garage under the house, where cars with diplomatic plates spent several hours after driving from the consulate building on the day he vanished. At least four diplomatic vehicles are included in the investigation.FacebookTwitterPinterestMike Pompeo meets Saudi Arabia’s King Salman in Riyadh. Photograph: Leah Mills/APMohammad al-Otaibi, the consul general, has not been seen in public since the scandal erupted. Turkish television and semi-official Anadolu news agency said on Tuesday evening that he left Turkey on a commercial flight hours before his residence was expected to be searched.Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, relocated from Saudi Arabia to the US last year, where he wrote for the Washington Post. He visited the Saudi consulate building in Istanbul on 2 October for an appointment to pick up documents for his forthcoming marriage and has not been seen since.Turkish officials allege they have video and audio evidence that proves Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered by a 15-man hit squad sent from Riyadh. Saudi Arabia says the claims are false, although it has offered no alternative version of events.Play Video1:00Jamal Khashoggi: CCTV shows alleged Saudi hit squad's movements – videoTurkish investigators were allowed access to the diplomatic building for the first time on Monday afternoon, shortly after cleaners with disinfectant, mops and buckets were seen entering the building’s main door.Although it is unclear what evidence could be extracted two weeks after Khashoggi vanished, forensic vehicles took away soil samples after a nine-hour search as well as a metal door from the garden. A second swoop of the premises is planned for Tuesday.Ankara has wanted to search the consulate and residence for days but, under the Vienna convention, diplomatic posts are technically foreign soil that must be protected and respected by host countries.Play Video0:48Donald Trump says 'rogue killers' may have murdered Jamal Khashoggi - videoKhashoggi wrote extensively for the Washington Post aboutSaudi Arabia, criticising its war in Yemen, the recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women’s rights activists after the lifting of Saudi Arabia’s driving ban for women. Those policies are viewed as initiatives of Bin Salman, who is next in line to the throne.Khashoggi’s family, who said they have been left to “sadly and anxiously follow the conflicting news”, called on Monday for an independent investigation into his disappearance.How Jamal Khashoggi disappeared – visual guideRead more“The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death,” the statement read.The call was echoed on Tuesday by the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, who urged Ankara and Riyadh to waive diplomatic immunity in the case and “reveal everything they know about the disappearance and possible extrajudicial killing” of Khashoggi.TopicsJamal KhashoggiSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and North AfricaUS foreign policyJournalist safetyRecep Tayyip ErdoğannewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/jamal-khashoggi-disappearance-mike-pompeo-saudi-arabia-salman,Bethan McKernan,"

"New national guidelines for diagnosing autism announced by the federal government on Tuesday will have no impact on those with autism previously deemed eligible for funding under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), the minister for social services, Paul Fletcher, has said.The guidelines, which aim to make assessment and diagnosis of autism more consistent, will not make it more difficult for people to qualify for the NDIS in future, Fletcher added.Autism tests vary between states and territories, with no established biological test available to diagnose the condition. Instead, diagnosis is based on the judgment of doctors, who assess the patient’s behaviours and developmental conditions. This inconsistency prompted the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism to develop the first national guidelines.Almost 6,000 doctors sign letter to PM demanding children be taken off NauruRead moreFletcher told the ABC the guidelines were developed in consultation with people living with autism, researchers and doctors, and had been approved by the NationalHealthand Medical Research Council.“It does not change what the NDIS does and indeed it may well be that there are people who, today, would not be diagnosed who will be diagnosed,” he said. “That will be a judgment for clinicians and medical profession and the NDIS will continue to do what it does, which is make an assessment of the impairment that somebody suffers as a result of a disability. Is it likely to be permanent and lifelong? Is it significant? What impact does it have on the functioning?”Dr Wenn Lawson, the co-chair of the Australian Autism Research Council, said a consistent assessment and diagnosis process for autism meant people would be able to access more appropriate supports.“I cannot stress enough the impact this will make,” he said. “Appropriate assessment identifies what an individual needs to enable access to learning and to life. These requirements must be implemented to enable an individual to be ‘connected’ rather than closed off because their needs are passed over. This Australian-first guideline provides a unified policy.”About 164,000 Australians, including 136,000 children and young people under the age of 25, have autism spectrum disorder, a 79% increase from 2009.TopicsHealthnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/coalition-says-new-autism-guidelines-wont-affect-ndis-access,Melissa Davey,"

"United Nationsbody has taken the “extraordinary” step of calling on Australia to review its domestic laws in a ruling that it had breached multiple international human rights laws.The ruling coincides with the Australian government being taken to the UN over alleged breaches of international law by indefinitely separating more than 60 members of 14 refugee families onNauruThe working group on arbitrary detention,established by the UN Commission on Human Rightsin 1991 to report to the Human Rights Council, had examined the case of Edris Cheragi, an Iranian man and Christian convert who sought asylum in Australia.Cheragi has been detained in various detention centres and in the community since 2012, but in 2015 was charged with criminal offences and had his bridging visa cancelled. He has never been convicted.Instead Cheragi was placed in “administrative detention” under the laws of the Migration Act, and has been in detention ever since.The working group said Cheragi’s circumstances were just the latest of many cases of arbitrary detention in Australia, and ruled the Australian government had breached multiple articles of the universal declaration of human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights.Almost 6,000 doctors sign letter to PM demanding children be taken off NauruRead moreCheragi’s detention was based “purely on his earlier exercise of the legitimate right to seek asylum and is therefore arbitrary”.“The [Australian] government has not provided any explanation for the continued detention of Mr Cheragi since 30 October 2015 aside from the fact his visa was cancelled on 11 September 2015,” it said.It acknowledged that Cheragi’s detention was in accordance with the domestic act, but said Australia must ensure detention was also consistent with international law.It called for the government to review its Migration Act, immediately release Cheragi and give him access to compensation and other reparations, as well as launch an independent investigation into his detention and ensure action against those responsible for the violation of his rights.It was the seventh working group opinion in two years calling for the release of individual asylum seekers from Australian detention centres.The Australian government told the working group it was committed to “an effective and robust international protection program”, and that it considered mandatory immigration detention to be an essential component of strong border control.Cheragi had been granted a bridging visa and released from detention, the government said, and was only redetained after being arrested and charged.Alison Battisson, the director principal of law firm Human Rights for All and the source of Cheragi’s submission to the working group, described the call for a review of the act as “an extraordinary step” towards a sovereign nation.“In doing so the UN has highlighted Australia’s appalling practice of using detention as a default mechanism for asylum seekers and refugees,” she said. “How many more times will the Australian government – now led by the ‘new’ Liberal party – ignore the recommendations of a sub-body of the very council it campaigned to get a seat on?”Cheragi has a history of mental illness and continues to be assessed as being at high risk of self-harm. Cheragi’s asylum claim has been assessed and denied, the government told the working group.The case is one of two significant interventions involving the UN in Australia’s increasingly condemned immigration detention system.A family separation case, brought by the Human Rights Law Centre, is seeking orders from the UN’s Human Rights Committee, the world’s highest human rights authority, for the immediate reunion of the families.“Instead of forcing people to choose between the cruelty of indefinite detention and the cruelty of family separation, the government should just put a handful of people on a plane and reunite these families in Australia,” said Daniel Webb, the director of legal advocacy for the Human Rights Law Centre.Among the families are five babies born in Australia whose fathers remain on Nauru.Some families were separated because they arrived on different dates either side of the federal government’s 2013 pronouncement that all boat arrivals would be sent offshore.Three Liberal MPs push Morrison to take child refugees and families off NauruRead moreOthers were split when one member was taken to Australia for urgent medical treatment and forced to leave members of their family behind.Nasreen and her adult daughter Mahboubeh are currently in Australia for Nasreen to receive medical treatment. They have not seen Nasreen’s two older children –Narges and Daryoush, who were made to stay on Nauru– for more than four years.“When I transferred to Australia for treatment it was as if someone suggested that I choose between my left and right hand,” Nasreen said. “Whoever separates a mother from her children does not help, but tortures them. All of my medical records show my physical and mental illnesses have not improved after moving to Australia. No mother can be well when her son and daughter suffer mentally and physically.”The Afghan Hazara familyhave all been found to be refugeesin need of protection, including their father, who arrived in Australia earlier and has settled here.

"Telstrais considering an overhaul of how it calculates executive bonuses after suffering a first strike from shareholders opposed to its remuneration report.More than 60% of investors voted against the telco’s remuneration report at Tuesday’s annual general meeting, raising the prospect of a board spill in 12 months if it doesn’t address widespread unhappiness among shareholders.If more than 25% of shareholders vote against the remuneration report at next year’s AGM, it would constitute a second strike and trigger a forced spill of board positions.Australia's executive pay backlash hits Telstra and TransurbanRead moreThe chairman, John Mullen, told Tuesday’s meeting there could be merit to replacing complex remuneration calculations with a traditional payment structure such as half-cash, half-shares locked in for five years.“Maybe there is a case for doing away entirely with all these complex schemes and just go back to a fixed salary commensurate with the difficulty of the role,” he said. “The AGM would be over in half the time.”Mullen admitted executive salaries were too high “across the board” but said he was disappointed with the rejection of a plan to cut bonuses by 30% for a year in which dividends fell nearly a third.He said he understood some shareholders still felt the bonuses were too high, but blamed a broader corporate culture in which executives were generously rewarded in other industries.“I personally believe that executive salaries are too high across the board, but changing this takes time and needs to be embraced by all of corporate Australia not just one company or one industry, as the marketplace for talent is international and is industry-agnostic,” Mullen said.Mullen said Telstra’s two most recent chief executives had received lower salaries than their predecessors – and that was likely to continue when Andy Penn eventually stepped down.“The bottom line is that it would seem that, for many shareholders, if they see the value of their shares diminish, then they consider management has performed badly and should not receive any of their variable compensation,” he said.“The issue here is clearly the outcome not the scheme, and this means that we can make all the changes we like to the scheme and we will never please everybody.”Mullen said 2018-19 would be another difficult year for Telstra but urged shareholders to hold tight.In June, Telstra announced it would axe 8,000 jobs.The secretary of Unions NSW, Mark Morey, questioned why executives were pocketing millions in bonuses while workers faced unemployment.“It’s about executives taking enormous pay bonuses while they’re obviously contracting out the workforce, increasing job insecurity and not investing in a workforce that can deliver to Australian businesses and Australian families,” he said.Telstra shares were down 1.6% at $3.05 on Tuesday afternoon.TopicsExecutive payTelstraBusiness (Australia)Australian economynewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/executive-pay-too-high-across-whole-of-corporate-australia-telstra-chairman,,"

"The Queensland parliament has agreed to hold a conscience vote to decriminalise abortion; but after a day of debate, support for the legislation remains split firmly along party lines.On Tuesday, the parliament heard emotional personal stories.Nikki Boyd, the Labor member for Pine Rivers, said she went through a miscarriage in 2016 when a committee was considering abortion law reform. She is now pregnant again.'They shot a rifle over my fence': the bitter fight for abortion rights in QueenslandRead moreThe Labor MP for Redlands, Kim Richards, said her mother had previously told her about falling pregnant as a young woman in 1963.“They had two choices, for mum to be sent away to the country, or to access a termination,” Richards said. “It was a backyard termination. It was just that, but we don’t know the details or the damage done. Let me tell you, my mum was very lucky to get away with her life.”Critically, no Labor MPs have spoken against the legislation. The bill will pass unless four government MPs cross the floor to oppose it.Several members of the opposition said they supported the removal of abortion from the 1899 criminal code, but would only support the Palaszczuk government’s bill if it was watered down.At the outset of the debate, LNP MP Mark McArdle announced he would push for several amendments, including reducing the proposed gestation limits from 22 weeks to 16 weeks.The bill, and the proposed amendments, were criticised as potentially moving Queensland to extreme positions.The health minister, Steven Miles, said he had been “appalled by the wilfiul provision of misinformation to women making this decision”.“Some members will try to mislead this house today, as they have before, so before we start what could be a long debate lets get some facts on the record.“This bill will not increase late-term abortions. It will not lead to sex-selective abortions. It won’t allow women to terminate their pregnancies up until birth. Women won’t start using abortion as their preferred method of contraception.”The opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, said the bill was “not about protecting ... women. It is about politics pure and simple.“We now have the most ideologically-driven government Queensland has ever seen and it is determined to destroy the consensus Queensland has seen over many years.“My own view is that medically supervised terminations for medical reasons should remain legal. I do not believe that abortion should be available on demand. But as a woman and a mother I could never support abortion on demand after 22 weeks.”Deputy LNP leader Tim Mander said the bill was “morally wrong” and said the foetus in the womb “is a baby, it is a human being”.The proposed laws would allow abortion to 22 weeks and thereafter with the permission of two doctors. It would enforce 150m safe access zones to restrict protesters around termination clinics and remove all reference from the criminal code.McArdle’s amendments would scrap the safe access zones. They would also allow doctors who conscientiously object to refuse to refer women to another medical practitioner.Debate will continue on Wednesday. A final vote is expected on Thursday.TopicsQueensland politicsAbortionnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/queensland-abortion-vote-set-to-split-along-party-lines,Ben Smee,"

"he Australian Senatealmost passed a motion affirming that “it’sOK to be white”. This probably sounds innocuous enough to the casual or incurious observer — and that’s exactly what the white supremacists who devised the slogan intended.To understand how and why the slogan came to be voted on by the Senate, you need first to engage with the malicious, trolling doublethink that characterises the worst parts of the internet.Government blames 'administrative error' for its support for 'it's OK to be white' voteRead moreThe idea of using “it’s OK to be white” as part of a far right political project emerged around a year ago on the message board 4chan.Always a home for trolls, over time certain boards on 4chan and its cousin 8chan have become nerve centres for far right activism.The notion cooked up by one of the site’s anonymous users was that a postering campaign featuring the ostensibly inoffensive slogan would “trigger” leftists and journalists, who would immediately understand its racist intent.Then, the plan held, overreaction from these groups would appal “normies”, or normal, average Americans. They would be then be drawn towards the far right after they concluded that “leftists and journalists hate white people”.Many people – and not just people on the right – try to minimise the danger of surging far right movementsAccording to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), fliers were duly distributed in at least six states last Halloween, as well as in Alberta, Canada.But several problems immediately beset this would-be covert action.The first is that, as the ADLpoints out, the slogan has been used by white supremacists for decades, and it was immediately identifiable as a racist meme.White power bands were using it for song titles as far back as 2001, and it was appearing on white supremacist fliers as long ago as 2005.That’s no surprise – “it’s OK to be white” perfectly expresses the sense of white victimhood that pervades white supremacist movements that see any demand for racial justice as an attack on white identity.The consequences of Steve Bannon's ideas need to be interrogated, not just his words | Jason WilsonRead moreThe slogan neatly encapsulates the imaginary universe of “reverse racism”, wherein critiques of white supremacy and structural racism are turned inside out, and used as evidence of anti-white racism. It captures the mindset that accuses those opposed to racism of being, themselves, racist.The second problem the memers faced was that after originating in the bowels of chan culture, the plan was immediately adopted and promoted by prominent neo-Nazis and Klansmen.First, it was promoted by what may be the world’s most prominent neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer. Then, former KKK grand wizard David Duke claimed the campaign was “sweeping the nation”.And immediately it became the basis for further action by open white nationalists.Morepostering campaignsfollowed. Peoplefoundcards with the slogan printed on them inside boxes of nappies at Target, complete with links to white supremacist websites. It was used indemonstrationsfeaturing white nationalists, like the banner drop that happened in south west Washington, not far from Portland, last November.By then, “it’s OK to be white” had become a calling card for the trolls, con artists and sincere racists that make up the far right.Right wing troll and grifter Milo Yiannopoulospromotedthe slogan, thenput it ona T-shirt (asimilar shirtwas spotted on his fellow charlatan Lauren Southern when shelandedin Brisbane earlier this year).Then professional prevaricator Tucker Carlsonattempted to whitewashthe slogan on his show, which, during the Trump era, has become a reliable conduit for white nationalist talking points. The slogan, and the fake debate about its merits, had become mainstream.“It’s OK to be white” followed a path that many awful ideas have taken in the Trump era — from the cesspits of the alt right internet, through an increasingly confident far right street movement, and on through the self-aggrandising provocateurs who occupy increasingly prominent positions in conservative media.Finally it got toPauline Hanson. Then, unbelievably, it came to a vote in the Australian Senate.Notwithstanding the white supremacist origins of the slogan, and the sentiment of white victimhood that underpins it, that body almost passed a motion supporting it.The fact that this happened with the support of government ministers — including the Indigenous affairs minister — is beyond disheartening.It’s not that these Liberal and National ministers are Nazis, as far as we know. Indeed, they’re making excuses, claiming disorganisation, confusion and mistakes.But this is still damning — Hanson has been Australia’s most prominent xenophobe for a generation. If you can’t be bothered looking hard at the proposals she is bringing to the Senate, this suggests at the very best a dangerous complacency.But it is hard not to suspect that some on that side voted for it out of a juvenile urge to upset their opponents on the left. Some may have been effectively endorsing white supremacy to “own the libs”.Hard-right columnists with no mass audience cause enough turmoil to ruin leaders | Jason WilsonRead moreMany people – and not just people on the right – try to minimise the danger of surging far right movements. They say that these groups are small, have no access to power, and that their ideas have limited appeal for mainstream Australians.In a small way, the debacle in the Senate shows how wrong-headed this is. The far right lies, sows confusion, and hides its intentions in order to mainstream its messages. Careless, ignorant or actively sympathetic politicians help them.And each time a white supremacist meme receives a public airing, the Overton window shifts a little in favour of the racist far right.In a country which already enacts punitive and xenophobic border policies, which has not reconciled itself with its Indigenous people, and which regularly subjects prominent people of colour to prolonged public shaming, racist memes should not be treated as a joke.The Senate is another matter.Jason Wilson is a Guardian writer and columnistTopicsFar rightOpinionPauline HansonAustralian politicsOne NationCoalitioncommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/its-ok-to-be-white-is-not-a-joke-its-careless-politicians-helping-the-far-right,Jason Wilson,"

"f a bricklayer builds a wall that falls over 12 years later, killing someone, the bricklayer can be sued and even jailed. If a doctor finds some old packets of thalidomide in their surgery and, in spite of the overwhelming scientific evidence of its horrific effects, dispenses it to pregnant women, they would go to jail. The example can be multiplied endlessly: the reality of our world is that we are responsible for our acts.Unless, that is, you are an Australian politician.A politician can destroy our future, a politician can ignore the best evidence and be responsible for decisions that lead to deaths of many and the suffering of all, and still be free until the end of their days to milk the legal corruption that is Australian public life, picking up highly paid sinecures as ambassadors, board directors and lobbyists for the corporations they were once meant to regulate in our interest.Wentworth byelection: John Hewson urges Liberal 'drubbing' over climate changeRead moreLast Monday there came the unbelievable news contained in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. If large-scale action is not taken nowwe will face a global warming catastropheThe report was a nightmarish scream heard through a spithood of formal scientific language. Any rise above 1.5C is highly likely to be disastrous, with millions of people displaced by rising seas, the extinction of numerous species, and the loss of most coral reefs. At 2C the rate of crop loss doubles, as does the decline in sea fisheries. Almost all coral reefs will be dead. Diseases such as dengue and malaria will be far more widespread, extreme droughts and floods far more common, while security and economic growth will be imperilled.One of the report’s lead authors, the geographer Adelle Thomas, said, “The scientific consensus is really strong. It’s not just a political slogan: ‘1.5 to stay alive.’ It’s true.”The report was specific in how long we have to keep warming at 1.5C: until 2030.Twelve years.This Saturday the voters of Wentworth have the opportunity to turn their byelection into a referendum on climate change. If you are a Wentworth voter, consider the historic responsibility you have and how in the past you have used it to good effect. Last year it was Wentworth, after all, that voted 80.8% yes for marriage equality, the fourth-highest yes vote in the nation.Marriage equality, as many have since noted, was not given to us by enlightened politicians. It was forced on a recalcitrant government by the countless acts of individual courage shown by those who stood up in their workplaces, families, in their kitchens, cafes, sporting clubs, for their dignity and freedom; it was made possible by organisation and a passion that transcended party loyalties, and could not finally be refused. Marriage equality was won by the people, in other words, not gifted by the politicians.Our prime minister, a man with a wit that would make Kenny look like Oscar Wilde,once thought it funny to wave a lump of coal in parliamentduring the middle of one of eastern Australia’s worst heatwaves. Luckily he had Barnaby Joyce there to laugh. With a similar bro and brio he dismissed the IPCC report while speaking to Alan Jones, saying he wouldn’t be bound by its recommendations. His deputy, Michael McCormack, declared the government would not change policy “just because somebody might suggest thatsome sort of report is the way we need to follow”.FacebookTwitterPinterestScott Morrison brings a chunk of coal into parliamentThat “some sort of report” – the findings of 91 of the world’s most eminent climate change scientists surveying more than 6,000 studies of the most recent research – didn’t trouble McCormack because he hadn’t read the report. Neither had our environment minister, Melissa Price, who told ABC radio the IPCC report, whatever the shared judgment of its global expertise, was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050.But then, of course, this is the same government that offers total political support for the Adani coalmine at a time when the IPCC says coal must be phased out. This is the same government thatgranted $440m to a foundation that never asked for the cash, to deal with water runoff and the crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef when the science is clear that climate change is what will kill the reef.We have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we thinkAnd this is the same government that has no policies to meet Australia’s commitments to the Paris climate agreement. This is the same government that hides shameful greenhouse emissions reports showing our pollution increasing byreleasing them in the days before Christmas, without publicity.And its leader, our prime minister, is the man who says that “we’re doing well” when the government’s own figures show that our pollution is increasing.The Liberal candidate Dave Sharma echoes the same smug complacency of the Liberal government he expects to join next Monday.“I do think we are doing enough,” Sharma has said, “and I do think we have had a good record on climate change. Emissions are at their lowest levels in 28 years,” he said. The evidence is otherwise: absolute emissions continue to rise and areamong the highest in the OECDLike our prime minister, who claims we will meet our Paris agreement targets “in a canter”, Sharma says: “We are on track to meet the Paris commitments and I believe we will address the Paris commitments and we will be addressing affordability and sustainable and coherent energy policy.”Sharma’s diplomatic wording cloaks the truth: the Liberal government is the Aleppo of energy policy. It has none, only the shell-shocked ruins of a once great party. As for the Paris climate targets, according to consultants, NDEVR Environmental,Australia is on a trajectory that will see it fail to reach themIn the face of such sustained stupidity by our leaders many Australians have felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness.But we should not.If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and businessAs the marriage equality vote showed, as the Sydney Opera House controversy revealed, if we choose to exercise our power we discover that we are not as we have so often been told, small and mean and self-serving, cast in the shrivelled image of our politicians. To the contrary, we have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we think – and that when we dare to exercise it, that the power is ours.In evading their responsibilities on climate change, our politicians have been irresponsible to the point of what would be, in any other sphere of life, criminality.If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and business.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, recently warned “of the catastrophic impacts that climate change could have for the world financial system”.“We accept the IPPC assessment of climate change and that human influence is clear and that the physical impacts are unavoidable,” Jac Nasser, the former chairman of BHP, the world’s biggest resource company, declared, while Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Google, said: “The facts of climate change are not in question. People who oppose it are hurting our children and making the world a worse place. They’re just simply lying.” Listen to Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, who has stated “We’ve turned a corner on climate change … overwhelmingly, I think it’s got to a point where the science is very acceptable.”These are hardly the lunatic voices of the far left. It is clear that the traditional constituencies of the Coalition, business and farmers, support major action on climate change – as do the majority of Australians according to all published research, as do the majority of people in Wentworth.Yet the government, from the prime minister down, dismisses the issue. Indeed, both the government and Sharma, state that they are “doing enough” on climate change.Don't despair: the climate fight is only over if you think it is | Rebecca SolnitRead moreThe very phrase drips with the contempt of our political class for Australian citizens who they take for passive fools, easily manipulated. As with marriage equality we see a polity determined to do nothing.Since 2013, the Coalition government in its various incarnations has lied, laughed and destroyed when it comes to this most fundamental matter: that of our future. Their record is one of deceit, obfuscation and craven capitulation to the fossil fuel industry. It is a party that has evaded its most fundamental responsibility to our land and our people, and the time for a reckoning has arrived.This Saturday, voters of Wentworth can lead Australia as they did in the marriage equality survey. They can make the byelection a referendum on climate change by voting the candidate they believe has the best climate policy number 1, any who might have a reasonable policy from 2 to 15, and put Dave Sharma at 16.“We have presented governments with pretty hard choices,” Prof Jim Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC panel has been quoted as saying. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will.”Wentworth byelection forum: the 'good-hearted people' and the missing LiberalRead moreThe most important thing a voter can do on election day is demonstrate that this threat to our future must be our politicians’ number one priority, and give our politicians the political will to act now.There is so much beauty in this world. Sometimes it is hard to believe this life that is given us. Sometimes it is hard to believe that it is possible to change it for the better, or save it from the worst. But from today we must, and we can.If we take our compass from power we will know only despair. But if we take our compass from those around us and their actions we discover hope. It is time we rediscovered not partisan division but a common humanity ready to take on our gravest crisis. It is time we acted, and theWentworth byelectionis the first chance Australians have. Our tomorrows are running out. We have only today.Play Video3:48Australia's climate wars: a decade of dithering – videoRichard Flanagan is the Man Booker prize winning Australian authorBusinessman Geoff Cousins is a former Howard government adviserTopicsWentworth byelectionAustralian politicsScott MorrisonClimate changeIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)commentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/our-leaders-are-destroying-our-future-wentworth-must-be-a-referendum-on-climate-change,"Richard Flanagan,Geoff Cousins","

"he problem I have with “identity politics” is that it’s a phrase mostly used by people who don’t name their identities, against those who do. We all have identities, after all, and in racialised societies like this one it’s ethnic minorities who are guilty of playing “identity politics” for having the audacity to own, articulate or organise around that experience. Meanwhile the majority, who have the luxury of regarding their identities as normal, neutral and invisible, have always mobilised politically around class, region, and whiteness. But that’s not identity politics, that’s just politics, right?Donald Trump rains insults on Elizabeth Warren after DNA testRead moreAll politics are identity politics and, if we really want to use the term, the rightwing purveyors of nativist populism have been among the most devoted practitioners. Remember Margaret Thatcher, invoking Churchillian nativism over the Falkland Islands, whose population, “like the people of the United Kingdom, are an island race”. There is nothing at the moment to suggest the next US presidential election will be between anything other than two white candidates, but that won’t stop Donald Trump from using racist slurs. Because the first campaign video has just landed – with themidterm electionsnot yet even out of the way – and it’s all about race and identity.EnterElizabeth Warren. You may not be that familiar with her yet, but you will be. Or you might know her better as “Pocahontas”, or even “fake Pocahontas” – the name the president uses to mock her claim of Native American heritage. It is, in the darkly effective attention-seeking that is his way, an insult that somehow manages to say Warren has no legitimate claim to be Native American, while simultaneously insulting those who do.Warren is not really saying she is Native American. That ethnic status has specific meaning in the US, where membership is a question of meeting requirements for tribal citizenship rather thansimply proving lineage. But there’s nothing to suggest Warren has been claiming that status. She is – as she says – simply telling a story about her family’s identity.FacebookTwitterPinterestAnd until recently, she had barely been doing that. The Harvard law professor-turned-senator was better known for a string of “caring capitalism”-type measures: better consumer protection, laws, not unlike those proposed by Labour in Britain, that would give workers the power to hold corporations to account.But by going into her family background, in the inevitably polarising context of an impending election, Warren’s new video performs a few useful tasks simultaneously. It delves into a down-home Oklahoma narrative about an ordinary middle-class family: three older, brothers all of them former military, some of them Republican voters, and her “momma and daddy”, hardworking Americans who married when barely out of their teens. It doesn’t take a strategic genius to see the utility of this for someone who has been a Harvard law professor – which, as we saw in the backlash to Obama, has come to symbolise the “liberal metropolitan elite” identity that populists, so often themselves the very definition of privilege, have successfully weaponised.The real point of the film, though, is to show up Trump-type bigotry. It reveals the attitude of her father’s family, which she says was “bitterly opposed” to the fact that her mother was part Native American. “That kind of discrimination,” she says, looking at sepia photos of this family from a time when Oklahoma had only recently ceased to be an Indian nation and become a federal state, “was common at the time.”Play Video1:06Elizabeth Warren hits back at Donald Trump by releasing DNA test – video reportThere’s an interview with a cousin who is a citizen of the Cherokee nation, and then – in a big reveal – test results that “suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestry in your pedigree,” says Carlos Bustamante, a professor of genetics at Stanford, who analysed Warren’s DNA.This makes uncomfortable watching. First of all, the relationship between race and genetics is dodgy as hell. The more we understand genetics, the less we understand race – scientists have tried and failed to find any real correlation between the physical characteristics that distinguish us in visible terms from the patterns in DNA variations between us. Ancestry companies, whose business is booming, have focused most of their research on people of northern European descent and very little on everyone else, so just how much they can tell us about someone like Warren’s family is up for debate. Race is actually what Warren is saying it is – a societal experience, a cultural heritage, a shared memory. It’s unwise to police who does and does not belong to those experiences from the outside.Which is why it’s disappointing that Warren should have taken the bait. Obama producing his birth certificate didn’t stop the birthers’ claims – seven years later, a quarter of Republicansstill believe them. Why should a far less convincing DNA test stop Trump? He’s already – follow this if you can – denying having denied Warren had Native American heritage anyway. Truth has zero role to play here.Warren hasn’t used her distant ancestry to mislead. She has dealt with it in the slightly confused way that people with mixed heritage – myself included – often have. And, even though the question as to whether she might have been entitled to use this heritage to claim minority status in university and job applications is an interesting one, she never tried.What’s surreal about this whole debate is that, in trying to belittle Warren’s Native American heritage, Trump has multiplied its symbolism. “Fake Pocahontas”: it’s utterly consistent with his need to find one-concept devices for delegitimising his opponents. Obama: “Kenyan”; Clinton: “Lock her up.”It’s hard to think of any other time when politics would have played out quite like this. In this era of cultural candidates and identity politics, there is on one side a politician who has been reduced to taking DNA tests to prove she is “real”, rather than “fake”; and on the other an incumbent who thinks this ludicrous framework is an appropriate one for a discussion about descending from the indigenous – and still oppressed – inhabitants of his land. I have a feeling about which one is going to be accused of playing identity politics, though, and it’s not going to be Trump.Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnistTopicsUS midterms 2018OpinionElizabeth WarrenDonald TrumpDemocratscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/donald-trump-pocohontas-elizabeth-warren-midterms,Afua Hirsch,"

"t was the one last wafer-thin wisecrack that made Bill Buckner snap. On 4 July 1993 he was signing autographs in a parking lot outside McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, and when a boy passed him a ball to sign a man passing behind them said: “Don’t give him the ball, he’d just drop it anyway.” Buckner left, dumped his stuff in his truck, came back, grabbed the man by the collar and pinned him up against a wall. Buckner managed to stop himself from punching the guy – “thank God for that” – but it was right around then that Buckner finally decided it was time to for him and his family to quit Massachusetts and move to Idaho.Buckner had a 20-year career in Major League Baseball, turned out for five different sides, made 2,715 hits in 9,397 at-bats. But he’s famous for one thing –letting a ground ball hit by Mookie Wilson slip between his legsin the 10th innings of game six of the 1986 World Series.The Red Sox were so close to winning the series that the trophy had already been brought into their clubhouse, along with a case of champagne. Then Buckner’s mistake cost them the game. Two days later they lost game seven too, and the series with it. Seven years later, the fans were still ragging Buckner about it “at least once a week during the season”.Harry Pearson: The heroism, the glory ... the cock-upRead moreThirty years later, people still talk about pulling a “Buckner”. Eduardo Núñez had one just last month, while he was playing third baseagainst the Yankees. Earlier in the summer, JR Hildebrand spoke about his “Buckner moment” when hecrashed on the last bend leading the Indy 500. Back in January, New Orleans safety Marcus Williams had his Bucknerwhen he missed a tacklethat allowed the Minnesota Vikings to win their play-off game in the last seconds. Back in 2015, Barack Obama gave a speech in Boston in which he said that if the Republicans shut down the government it would be like “a ground ball slipping through somebody’s legs”. He got booed.There are three ways to get that famous playing sport. If they name something after you it usually means you either invented it, perfected it, or flubbed it so hard no one will ever let you forget. Like Freddie Burns. Whose horrific five minutes against Toulouse last Saturday led the Guardian’s headline writers tocoin the phrase “Doing a Freddie”So 115 years later, the fourth Ashes Test from 1902 is still called “Fred Tate’s match” because he dropped a catch at square leg. It was off Joe Darling, who was on 17 at the time, then went on to make the top score of 37. Just another 20 runs, then. But then Australia only won by three and Tate was the last man out too, bowled, for four.It was the first, and last, time Tate ever played for England. He is supposed to have said that he had “a young lad at home who’d put it right for me”. The boy was called Maurice, and he grew up to become one of England’s greatest bowlers. Which sounds like the sort of story we tell ourselves just because we like to hear a happy ending. Because they don’t often have them, these Icarus stories.Look at Lindsey Jacobellis. Back at the 2006 Winter Olympics, Jacobellis had such a big lead coming into the home stretch of the snowboard cross final that she decided to throw in a method grab just “for fun” asshe came over the penultimate jumpShe crash-landed, was overtaken by Tanja Frieden, and fetched up in second place. Jacobellis has won five world titles in snowboard cross, but never another Olympic medal. Since that race in 2006 she crashed in the Olympic semi-final once in Vancouver 2010, then again in Sochi in 2014, and then finished fourth, by just 0.003sec, in Pyeongchang this year. “Wouldn’t it just be nice if the media didn’t harangue me for something that happened 12 years ago?” Jacobellis told the New York Times. “I’m sure we can go into everyone’s past 12 years ago and pick out something that they coulda, shoulda, woulda done. It’s just mine was on a world stage.”It would be nice. Only, not all sports fans are. Which is why there’s something almost heroic about DeSean Jackson’s pigheaded refusal to learn from his mistakes. In the 2005 Army Bowl, Jackson decided to celebrate a touchdown by turninga somersault into the end zone. Only he landed the ball one foot short of where it needed to be so the score didn’t count.Then, in his rookie season for the Eagles, he ruined what would have been his very first NFL touchdown when hetossed the ball behind him as he crossed the goalline. Which didn’t stop him celebrating a 90-yard touchdown against the Cowboys by spinning on his heel andfalling backwards over the lineAs for Buckner, well, he went the best part of 10 years without ever returning to Fenway, or having anything much to do with baseball. But he finally made his peace with what happened to him. He came back to throw out the first pitch of the 2008 season, and even turned in a cameo riffing on it all in an episode ofCurb Your Enthusiasma couple of years later.In the end, all those photos and baseballs he signed put his kids through college. “It just amazes me. I don’t quite get it. I have come to the understanding that it is here to stay, so I try to look at it in a positive way,” he said. After all “there were a lot of players a lot better than me, and a lot of people can’t remember them”.TopicsBaseballUS sportsNFLcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/16/freddie-burns-bill-buckner-inglorious-failure,Andy Bull,"

"Scott Morrisonhasn’t stopped moving since taking the prime ministership from Malcolm Turnbull seven weeks ago. Perhaps it’s time he did for just a minute. Stop, and think.The government’s anxiety levels about the loomingWentworth byelectionhave been escalating over the past week or so, and understandably so, given there’s a lot on the line.A loss this coming weekend would mean the end of the Coalition’s one-seat majority in the House of Representatives – an event that would only serve to underline the huge transaction costs of a leadership change that has unsettled Australian voters, and has thus fardelivered zero political benefit to the governmentIndonesia reportedly 'considers' tearing up trade deal over Israel – politics liveRead moreSo if you are Morrison, and you are trying to hold your own show together, trying to defend the ship of state by forcing it into hyper-thrust, you might contemplate shock-and-awe measures,like floating a major foreign policy shiftin order to boost the Liberal party’s position in a single-seat byelection, with the objective of clinging on to power in your own right.This might seem like a good idea to a person who has everything on the line, who hasn’t stopped moving for seven weeks, and is probably only averaging a few hours sleep a night.But, in the real world, it isn’t a good idea.It’s a silly idea.It’s silly because the reason Australia hasn’t followed Donald Trump down this incendiary path is it would upset our relationship with Indonesia, andIndonesiais our most important near neighbour, ally and friend.When the idea of moving the embassy was assessed by Turnbull andJulie Bishop, given Trump’s position, it was dismissed on the basis that going full Trump would be counterproductive to Australia’s national interest.Even if you thought, as a new prime minister, that you were perfectly entitled to take a different view on a foreign policy question (and of course you are), there’s just a simple point of pragmatism articulated elegantly by Labor’s former foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans.Evans notes that, in a process this vexed, you never offer something for nothing.If progress was made on a Middle East peace settlement, you might get to a position recognising Jerusalem as the capital of both states “but you never, ever give something this big for nothing, and Benjamin Netanyahu has given less than nothing to any peace process”.Of course we need to be clear that Morrison isn’t really offering anything concrete, despite revealing his inclination to Netanyahu while sending a frantic heads-up to Jakarta.Australia’s prime minister is just spitballing, which is a novel way to conduct yourself on the international stage, with policy previously thought to be bipartisan.Morrison is not only spitballing, he’s narrowcasting.By bowling up a policy that might resonate in Wentworth (if you take the view that the Jewish community in Sydney’s eastern suburbs is exclusively conservative, entirely homogenous, is not already voting for Dave Sharma, and hasn’t already cast a pre-poll vote to avoid coming out on the sabbath) – you have to deal with the impact of that policy elsewhere.The risk is creating problems for yourself with other faith and ethnic communities, who also vote at general elections.Jerusalem embassy move a 'sensible' proposal, says Scott MorrisonRead moreMorrison says the timing of his putative shift is about a looming vote in the United Nations, it’s not about this Saturday’s political contest in the eastern suburbs of Sydney which, by some strange coincidence, happens to include a substantial Jewish population.But if you believe that, I’ve got a bridge I’d like to sell you.This is what it is, and gestures like it only encourage already disillusioned voters to look at their politics and conclude that this is a government intent on no more than governing from minute to minute, endlessly mortgaging our collective future for the present.TopicsScott MorrisonCoalitionLiberal partyAustralian politicsIsraelWentworth byelectioncommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/16/morrisons-desperate-embassy-stunt-is-a-silly-idea-designed-for-him-to-cling-to-power,Katharine Murphy,"

"Late-night hosts covered Donald Trump’s reaction toElizabeth Warren’s DNA testresults and the president’s cowardice over the presumed killing of a journalist in Turkey.Disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi – timelineRead moreStephen ColbertFacebookTwitterPinterestOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert returned after a week off and joked: “I had this one weird dream. I could have sworn thatKanye Westwent to the Oval Office and started talking about repealing the 13th amendment.”He then spoke about the alleged murder ofjournalist Jamal Khashoggiin the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “The evidence is overwhelming that Saudi Arabia committed a horrific, violent act which can mean only one thing: we’re invading Iraq!”After denying involvement, reports suggested yesterday that the Saudi government was set to release a statement claiming his death was the result of an interrogation gone wrong. “Let me ask an obvious question: any interrogation that involves 15 men and a bone saw, how does that go right?” Colbert asked.Yet Trump refused to criticise Saudi Arabia and suggested the men involved were“rogue killers”. “This is one of the most disturbing human rights violations in recent memory and yet Donald Trump is bending over backwards to find excuses for Saudi Arabia, and keep in mind, he can barely bend forwards,” he said.FacebookTwitterPinterestColbert also spoke about the Democratic senatorElizabeth Warren, who has claimed her heritage is part Native American. “Some people don’t believe that, and his name is Donald Trump,” he said.He then showed many clips of Trump calling her “Pocahontas” at rallies, one of which had him saying it was affectionate. “It may be racist but it’s affectionate because Trump has great affection for racism,” he joked.Colbert also played a short film that showed Warren finding out the results. “You heard them right, this test accurately reveals with a high confidence that Elizabeth Warren is running for president,” he said.When asked about it, Trump claimed that no one cares. “You care! You’re literally the only person who cares!” Colbert fired back.Trevor NoahThe Daily Show(@TheDailyShow)TONIGHT: DNA plot twist in the Elizabeth Warren Native American heritage story!pic.twitter.com/db5xVvS3L3October 16, 2018John Oliver: Trump and Bin Salman are 'similar in some of the worst ways'Read moreOn The Daily Show,Trevor Noahalso spoke about the Warren test and Trump’s earlier claim that he would donate $1m if the results were accurate. “Because the president has spent the last two years calling Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’, today the press asked him if he would put his money where his cute butthole mouth is and pay up,” he said.He also joked about his assertion that he now doesn’t care. “Trump can’t suddenly say he doesn’t care,” Noah said. “Who cares? You care! This is a thing you’ve been obsessed about for years. It’s like the Kool-Aid Man saying :‘I don’t actually care about Kool-Aid.’”Noah continued: “Now he’s flipped. Even though Elizabeth Warren took the test, now he says he’s not going to pay the million dollars. So basically, this white man made a promise to Senator Warren and then went back on what he said, so I guess she really is Native American after all.”TopicsLate-night TV roundupTV comedyStephen ColbertTrevor NoahComedyTelevisionnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/16/late-night-roundup-colbert-warren-trump-saudi-arabia,,"

"ith the help of a World Cup andseismic change in the corridors of power, the usually interminable A-League offseason has flown by. We can now look forward to the first “straightforward” domestic campaign in yonks, one unencumbered by off-field distractions.The early signs are promising. There’s plenty of upbeat and meaningful publicity, some belting new signings, and a realistic possibility every club has strengthened since the end of last season.Keisuke Honda headlines the roll call of new recruits and the Japanese star can expect to be the most scrutinised man in the game over the coming weeks as the little-used mega-marquee model is once again put to the test. Honda aside, transfer activity has contained a strong focus on returning Socceroos, an indication the A-League’s reputation within the professional fraternity is as strong as ever and not necessarily the career cul-de-sac it might previously have been considered.Usain Bolt offered professional football deal in EuropeRead moreNo club has proven that point more than Perth Glory who have secured three Australian internationals from clubs overseas, as well as Socceroos squad member Tomi Mrcela. Such activity, along with the recruitment of new coach Tony Popovic, has shunted Glory into the leading pack of title contenders, a list that can again expect to include defending premiers Sydney FC and reigning championsMelbourne Victory– but possibly as many as eight sides so even is the distribution of talent and unpredictability caused by a 50% turnover of coaches.So before Adelaide and Sydney get us underway for another season on Friday night, here’s the first of two team-by-team guides, starting with the 2016 champions.Adelaide UnitedIns:Mirko Boland (Eintracht Braunschweig), Scott Galloway (Phoenix), Craig Goodwin (Sparta Rotterdam), Ben Halloran (V-Varen Nagasaki), Ken Ilsø (Penang), Michael Jakobsen (City)Outs: Johan Absalonsen (SønderjyskE), Daniel Adlung (mutual contract termination), Džengis Čavušević (end of contract), Tarek Elrich (Wanderers), Ben Garuccio (Hearts), Ersan Gulum (Hebei China Fortune – end of loan), Mark Ochieng (Adelaide Comets), Jordan O’Doherty (Wanderers)Following a couple of below-par seasons the buzz of expectation has returned to Adelaide. Ambitious new owners, a charismatic coach with his bedding-in season behind him, and some smart recruitment should return the Reds into the shake-up for silverware. Such optimism has already manifested in a run to the FFA Cup final, a feat achieved without conceding a goal. This form along with six clean sheets in nine other preseason friendlies suggests United will be tough to break down over the coming months.However, it’s at the other end of the pitch that will determine success for Marco Kurz. Adelaide have scored just 61 league goals over the past two seasons with no striker able to fill the void left by Bruce Djite. Responsibility for that task this season falls on the well-travelled Ken Ilsø and the former Denmark Under-21 international will hope the goalscoring burden is shared by fellow star recruits Craig Goodwin and Ben Halloran. Both now 26, the returning Socceroos are in the prime of their careers and with the well-credentialed Mirko Boland and the outstanding Isaias to feed them they could well light up Coopers Stadium.There’s no reasonAdelaide Unitedshouldn’t be among this season’s leading contenders.Brisbane RoarIns:Álex López (Sporting Gijón), Stefan Mauk (NEC), Tobias Mikkelsen (Nordsjaelland), Stefan Nigro (Victory), Adam Taggart (Glory), Dylan Wenzel-Halls (Western Pride)Outs: Fahid Ben Khalfallah (retired), Corey Brown (Victory), Ivan Franjic (Glory), Corey Gameiro (Mariners), Massimo Maccarone (Carrarese), Jade North (released), Mitch Oxborrow (Broadmeadow Magic), Michael Theo (released)This season looms as a career-defining one for John Aloisi. Entering his sixth campaign as a coach and fourth in charge ofBrisbane Roar, the Socceroos legend is under pressure to convert his obvious capabilities into trophies. Worryingly, Aloisi’s three previous seasons at the Roar have witnessed progressively fewer wins and goals, although in mitigation last season was blighted by injuries and off-field volatility. With a new training base and a more stable administration, Aloisi has fewer excuses should he fail to deliver.The Roar squad looks better equipped to compete, but as with all sides much rests on how successfully the impressive-looking new foreigners adapt to the competition. Álex López has La Liga experience while Tobias Mikkelsen earned eight caps for Denmark. If that pair fire, and Éric Bauthéac shows his true form after an underwhelming debut season, Brisbane should be safely in the finals mix.The difference between contending for silverware and lifting some could come down Aloisi’s ability to coax the best out of Adam Taggart. One of Australia’s smartest penalty box strikers, Taggart guarantees goals atA-Leaguelevel and at 25 is still young enough to secure a lucrative move overseas with an eye-catching season.FacebookTwitterPinterestAdam Taggart gets a close up look at the A-League trophy before the season starts. Photograph: Mark Metcalfe/Getty ImagesCentral Coast MarinersIns:Jonathan Aspropotamitis (Wanderers), Kalifa Cissé (BEC Tero Sasana), Jack Clisby (Wanderers), Corey Gameiro (Roar), Joe Gauci (West Torrens Birkalla), Josh Macdonald (Wollongong Wolves), Ross McCormack (Aston Villa – loan), Michael McGlinchey (Phoenix), Matthew Millar (South Melbourne), Jordan Murray (APIA Leichhardt), Tommy Oar (APOEL), Aiden O’Neill (Burnley – loan), Matt Simon (Sydney), Mario Shabow (Jets)Outs: Alan Baró (mutual contract termination), Josh Bingham (released), Wout Brama (Twente), Trent Buhagiar (Sydney), Daniel De Silva (Sydney), Tom Glover (Tottenham – end of loan), Jacob Poscoliero (released), Blake Powell (Ceres–Negros), Josh Rose (retired), Liam Rose (Ararat-Armenia), Storm Roux (Victory), Peter Skapetis (Dandenong Thunder), Lachlan Wales (City)Usain Bolt scores first two goals in bid to become a professional footballerRead moreLast year’s wooden spooners are the most difficult side in this year’s competition to appraise. With a new coach, a remodelled squad and the afterglow of an offseason basking in the attention of the global media, there is an air of excitement around Gosford that is all-too welcome after a succession of seasons in the doldrums.Mike Charlesworth has loosened the purse strings for Mike Mulvey, allowing him to recruit proven quality in Ross McCormack, Tommy Oar and Aiden O’Neill, and bring club legends Michael McGlinchey and Matt Simon back to their most successful stomping ground. However, after failing to reach the finals in the past four seasons Mulvey has a tough job on his hands simply making Central Coast competitive, let alone pushing for the postseason.Adding to the air of unpredictability isthe presence – for now – of Usain Bolt. It remains to be seen if the greatest sprinter of all time will play a competitive match for the Mariners, or whether the PR circus that he brings with him will prove a springboard or a handicap.A positive start to the campaign is essential. While there are reasons to be optimistic, failure to gain some early momentum could see the wheels fall off in familiar fashion.Melbourne CityIns:Kearyn Baccus (Wanderers), Florin Berenguer (Sochaux), Mark Birighitti (NAC Breda), Anthony Cáceres (Manchester City – loan), Ritchie De Laet (Aston Villa – loan), Curtis Good (Newcastle United), Rostyn Griffiths (Pakhtakor Tashkent), Riley McGree (Club Brugge – loan), Michael O’Halloran (Rangers), Lachlan Wales (Mariners)Outs: Daniel Arzani (Manchester City), Dean Bouzanis (PEC Zwolle – loan), Oliver Bozanic (Hearts), Marcin Budziński (Cracovia), Christian Cavallo (Green Gully), Nick Fitzgerald (Wanderers), Denis Genreau (PEC Zwolle – loan), Michael Jakobsen (United), Bruce Kamau (Wanderers), Stefan Mauk (NEC – end of loan), Manny Muscat (Green Gully), Ruon Tongyik (Wanderers)There remains a lingering sense that with the City Football Group empire behind themMelbourne Cityshould be the most exciting ticket in the A-League but reality continues to disappoint. Once again squad turnover has been significant, and once again marquee money has been spent on a player whose profile is unlikely to put additional bums on seats – defensive utility Ritchie De Laet.FacebookTwitterPinterestMelbourne City players are put through their paces during a pre-season training session. Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty ImagesNonetheless Warren Joyce has assembled a strong squad for his second season in charge. Riley McGree’s industry will be important for a side that can often lack dynamism in midfield while Florin Berenguer will be expected to provide the guile in the final third City have often struggled to find since Aaron Mooy’s exit.CFG have made no secret of their plans to use Melbourne as an incubator to develop and sell on young players and that project’s focus now falls onto Nathaniel Atkinson and Lachie Wales with a troupe of exciting youngsters ready to step up from the NYL squad and fill the boots of the departed Daniel Arzani and Denis Genreau if required. Keep an eye out for Young Socceroo Ramy Najjarine in particular.Melbourne VictoryIns: Nick Ansell (Tondela), Raúl Baena (Granada – loan), Corey Brown (Roar), Keisuke Honda (Pachuca), Georg Niedermeier (Freiburg), Storm Roux (Mariners), Ola Toivonen (Toulouse)Outs: Mitch Austin (Jets), Besart Berisha (Sanfrecce Hiroshima), James Donachie (Jeonnam Dragons), Leroy George (Baniyas), Cameron McGilp (Birmingham City), Stefan Nigro (Roar), Matías Sánchez (released), Christian Theoharous (Borussia Mönchengladbach), Pierce Waring (Cerezo Osaka), Rhys Williams (Al-Qadsiah).Victory have capitalised superbly on their championship success, dominating the transfer window with the signing of Japanese star Keisuke Honda and Russia 2018 goalscorer Ola Toivonen. Honda in particular is an inspired recruit from both a playing and marketing perspective, giving the A-League some genuine (and much-needed) marquee hype.While the big names provide plenty of expectation Kevin Muscat also has some difficult questions to answer. A lot of talent left the club in the offseason, including five of the 12 players that featured in the grand final triumph. Victory’s best two performers last season have gone (Leroy George and Rhys Williams) and while Besart Berisha was on the wane he was a near ever-present in Victory’s attack for four seasons. Muscat must now reestablish his preferred XI and manage a lean squad through both domestic and continental campaigns.Last season was proof you can never write Victory off but going back-to-back looks to be a tough ask without further recruits. Nonetheless, success this season may be as well measured on the impact Honda has on the club’s and the league’s bottom line, a project that is already progressing exceptionally well with Victory revealing on the eve of the season they are now the second-most valuable privately held sporting club in the country.TopicsA-LeagueAustralia sportAdelaide UnitedBrisbane RoarCentral Coast MarinersMelbourne CityfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/17/a-league-2018-19-preview-part-one-adelaide-united-to-melbourne-victory,Jonathan Howcroft,"

"A newly-discovered inscription at Pompeii proves the city was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius after 17 October AD79 and not on 24 August as previously thought.Archeologists recently discovered that a worker had inscribed the date of “the 16th day before the calends of November”, meaning 17 October, on a house at Pompeii, the head of archeology at the site, Massimo Osanna, told Italian media.Pompeii and Herculaneum were previously thought to have been destroyed by the massive eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 24 August, based on contemporary writings and archeological finds.Lost cities #4: Pompeii was preserved by disaster. Now it risks ruin all over againRead moreNevertheless, evidence such as autumnal fruits on branches found in the ashen ruins had suggested a later date since the 19th century, Osanna said.“Today, with much humility, perhaps we will rewrite the history books because we date the eruption to the second half of October,” said Italy’s culture minister, Alberto Bonisoli.Pompeii is the second most-visited tourist site inItaly, after the Colosseum in Rome, with more than 3 million visitors in the first eight months of this year.TopicsItalyArchaeologyClassics and ancient historyEuropenewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/archeological-find-changes-date-of-pompeiis-destruction,,"

"This is not just a fight over gay teachers.The faiths are battling to hang on to laws that leave them free to bar and sack a long list of sinners – men and women they claim might undermine the ethos of hospitals and charities as well as church schools.So who is on the list?Keeping up to date here is essential. It’s foolish to typecast churches as old fashioned. They’re all the time monitoring fresh challenges to the Christian mission of their agencies.Scott Morrison will change the law to ban religious schools expelling gay studentsRead moreThe lists of the forbidden are long and keep growing. Gays and adulterers head all the lists. But transsexuals were recently added to those who might be sacked and barred by the Sydney diocese of the Anglican Church.Bishop Michael Stead assured me last year they would not all be sacked. Not automatically. “That would require looking at on a case-by-case basis.” But he would guarantee none of their jobs in Anglican church agencies. Ditto an administrator, clerk, nurse, doctor or teacher who took advantage of new laws to marry one of their own sex.That would lead, said Stead, “to a discussion”.Not on most lists are the intersex. Most faiths let them off lightly andPhilip Ruddock’s religious freedom reviewcalls for their complete protection: “Jurisdictions should abolish any exceptions to anti-discrimination laws that provide for discrimination by religious schools in employment on the basis of race, disability, pregnancy or intersex status,” reads Ruddock’s sixth recommendation.So why let gays and transsexuals be sacked but spare the intersex? It’s obvious when you think about it: God made the intersex that way. Physically. (Trigger warning.) You can point to their parts.Where Catholics bishops go to ground and hide their human wreckage behind shimmering rhetoric, Anglicans are honest enough to say who they target. Stead laid out the list: gay men and women in relationships, open adulterers, the unchaste generally, men or women in de facto relationships and unrepentant single mothers.It should be noted that everyone on the Anglican list of shame can save themselves – and their jobs – by being seen to wrestle with their sins.“We’re not seeking the right to terminate employment in all these circumstances,” Stead explained. “It’s more a question of where a person’s practice or advocacy might cause issues of conflict with the religious ethos of the institutions.”But in hospitals? The intrinsic point of a Christian hospital, the bishop explained, is not to cure people but “to do that in accordance with the teachings of Christ”.By punishing homosexuals?“I wouldn’t agree with thepunishmentof homosexuals.”To lose a job is not punishment?“The intention is not to punish.”Some faiths also have divorcees on the list of the forbidden. Not, these days, the Anglicans. But Catholic schools have shown themselves unhappy continuing to employ teachers who divorce and remarry without first obtaining an annulment. Particularly susceptible here are kindergarten teachers in country towns.Representing sacked private school teachers is the work of John Quessy of the Independent Education Union. He said in a statement on Monday: “It’s pretty amazing that in this day and age teachers and support staff cannot openly discuss getting a divorce, being a single parent or seeking IVF treatment, let alone being in a single sex relationship, with their employer.”Ruddock religious freedom review: what is it and what do we know so far?Read moreScandalously late in 2013, the Commonwealth extended anti-discrimination protection to sexual orientation and gender identity. The job fell to Julia Gillard who gave in to the churches without a fight. The bishops and preachers were content with the exemptions Labor granted. So was the Coalition.At the time I called it a bigots charter. But perhaps Gillard should be praised for her bravery for she was legislating fearlessly against all women who, like her, are living in sin.Should the former prime minister wish to work some day as, say, a cleaner in an Anglican hostel her way might be barred under the law she passed 2013 so long as she remains unmarried to her partner Tim Mathieson.It’s all about the ethos of the institutions …Back then I sought out Stephen O’Doherty, spokesman for Christian Schools Australia. I wanted to know which sinners were on the forbidden list of those little Christian schools. Again, gaysand adulterers headed the list.What about masturbators, I asked. O’Doherty didn’t roar with laughter as I’d hoped. He took my question perfectly seriously. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard a teaching on that issue,” he said. But he wouldn’t rule it out.Comments on this thread are premoderatedTopicsMarriage equalityOpinionRuddock religious freedom reviewLGBT rightsAustralian politicsCatholicismAnglicanismcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/its-not-just-about-sacking-gay-teachers-the-church-has-a-long-list-of-sinners-it-wants-to-punish,David Marr,"

"enise Scott Brown was an associate professor when she marriedRobert Venturiin 1967. She had taught at the universities of Pennsylvania and Berkeley, and initiated the first programme in the new school of architecture at the University of California. She had a substantial publication record, enthusiastic students, and the respect of her colleagues.The first sign that marriage had changed things came when an architect whose work she had reviewed said: “We at the office think it was Bob writing, using your name.” It was an indication of what was to come for the rest of her career. Scott Brown was relegated to being the wife of the famous postmodern architect Bob Venturi –who died last month– rather than one half of an equal creative and intellectual partnership that changed the world of architecture as we know it.FacebookTwitterPinterest‘We’re not inviting wives’ … Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi in 1968. Photograph: George Pohl/Courtesy of Venturi Scott Brown and Associates, Inc.As she recounted in her 1989 essay,Room at the Top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture, there would be celebratory dinners where she was left out “because we’re not inviting wives”; job interviews where she was excluded because the presence of “the architect’s wife” distressed the board; countless meetings that began “So you’re the architect!” to Venturi, followed by: “And you’re an architect too?” To crown it all, when the 1991 Pritzker prize jury described how their body of work had “expanded and redefined the limits of the art of architecture in this century, as perhaps no other has”,the accolade was awarded to Venturi aloneIn 2013, two students at the Harvard Graduate School of Designbegan an online petitionto demand that her contribution be recognised. It now has more than 20,000 signatures. “They owe me not a Pritzker prize but a Pritzker inclusion ceremony,” Scott Brown said. “Let’s salute the notion of joint creativity.” Lord Peter Palumbo, chair of the prize, politely declined. “A later jury cannot reopen, or second-guess, the work of an earlier jury,” he wrote in response, before thanking the petitioners for “calling directly to our attention a more general problem, namely that of assuring women a fair and equal place within the profession”. Only a year earlier, his jury hadawarded the gong to Chinese architect Wang Shu, overlooking the fact that his practice has always been a joint partnership with his architect wife, Lu Wenyu.This month marks a small righting of past wrongs when Denise Scott Brown, now 87, will beawarded the 2018 Soane medal. She is the second recipient of an annual award given to architects who have made a major contribution to their field. I was part of the jury this year, and as soon as Scott Brown’s name was mentioned, all the other competition fell away. It was the most unanimous decision of any such deliberations I have witnessed.The individual contributions of creative partnerships are always difficult to disentangle. However, it is clear thatLearning from Las Vegas, the “gentle manifesto” published in 1972 that championed billboards and hot dog stands as worthy of architects’ attention, would never have happened without Scott Brown. She had already made several pilgrimages to the Vegas Strip by the time she took Venturi there in 1966, drawn by a fascination with roadside vernaculars and pop culture that she had developed growing up in South Africa. It also resonated with ideas she had learned in London from Alison and Peter Smithson, while studying at the Architectural Association, the Strip in effect being a very large “as-found” object.FacebookTwitterPinterestCo-creator … MJ Long, whose husband is often credited for the British Library. Composite: Alamy/Rolfe Kentish Long & Kentish architectsScott Brown chose Las Vegas as the subject she would teach at Yale with Venturi and Steven Izenour in 1968. She also coined the term “duck” to refer to buildings that act as sculptural, symbolic objects (in reference to a duck-shaped egg-stand on Long Island),set in opposition to the “decorated shed”, a functional box with ornament applied independently of what’s going on inside. The term has been popularised over the decades, often now referred to as the “Venturian duck”. Scott Brown once wrote to an editor to correct the attribution. Her letter was printed under the title “Less is a Bore”, a quotation from her husband.Scott Brown is not alone. A deeply institutionalised invisibility cloak has long obscured the women in successful architectural partnerships, whether it’sMJ Long’s work on the British Library, a project usually credited to her husband Colin St John Wilson, or Su Rogers and Wendy Foster’s work on early projects with their husbands, Richard and Norman (though Rogers feels she was always equally credited for her work and says she’s never suffered any discrimination from being a woman working in architecture). Patty Hopkins, co-founder of Hopkins Architects, was quite literally erased from history when she wasPhotoshopped out of a group of male hi-tech architectsto promote the 2014 BBC series, The Brits Who Built the Modern World. The global success of Daniel Libeskind, meanwhile, owes a huge amount to his wife,Nina, a fearsome political negotiator who has handled every aspect of the company’s management.Dutch artistMadelon Vriesendorphas been long accustomed to the lack of credit to the wives of maverick male architects. In the early 1970s, when she moved to New York with her husband, Rem Koolhaas, she began to paint a series of images inspired by the architecture of Manhattan.Her eerie dreamscapespictured the Statue of Liberty in states of undress, the New York skyline being gobbled up by a monster, and the Empire State Building in bed with the Chrysler Building, caught in the act by the Rockefeller Center. This last painting,Flagrant Délit, would become the cover of Koolhaas’s polemical book, Delirious New York, and would take on a mythology of its own. It was used on the cover of other books without permission, and was retrospectively captioned as being “commissioned by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture”, the architecture practice Vriesendorp co-founded.FacebookTwitterPinterestBedhopping buildings … Madelon Vriesendorp and her painting Flagrant Délit, which became associated with her husband Rem Koolhaas. Photograph: Shutterstock/Madelon Vriesendorp“I don’t want to make a fuss,” she says, sitting at the kitchen table of the flat in Hampstead where she formed OMA with Koolhaas and Elia and Zoe Zenghelis. “But there have been a lot of historical misprints, which continue to be repeated.”When she was awarded theAda Louise Huxtable prizeearlier this year by the Architectural Review, she mentionedthe #MeToo movement. But she stressed that, “more often, and more insidious, is the way that women are ignored, written out of the script, and invisible to the nakedly ambitious self-promoting eyes”. For these women, she quipped, “I would like to start a counter-movement, called ‘Me Neither’.”She says it was “a bit of a joke”, not intended to diminish #MeToo, and she downplays her role in the early days of OMA as “just colouring in”. The kind of colouring in thatMoMAhas collected, that is. “Me and Zoe were the sidekicks,” she claims. “I did the watercolours, she did the acrylics, and we packed everything up and took it to the post office when the men were too tired at the end of a deadline.”But theearly OMA schemesshow Vriesendorp’s influence. From the seminal Exodus project, an imagined walled cityof which she mademesmerising collages, to thecompetitions for the Dutch parliament, thehouse for the Irish prime ministerand theParc de la Villette in Paris, her distinctively surreal hand shines through in them all.FacebookTwitterPinterestTeamwork … Su Rogers, who co-designed the Pompidou in Paris. Composite: Alamy/RexLike Scott Brown, she has found the architectural establishment’s casual misogyny to be par for the course. One prominent dean of a US architecture school, when introduced to her by Koolhaas, refused to shake her hand. “I don’t believe in that feminist crap,” he said, as he turned away.We accepted all the bum-pinching and clumsy advances. There was this idea that men, poor things, have this urge, they just can't help themselves“We accepted everything,” she says. “All the bum-pinching and the clumsy advances. There was this idea that men, poor things, have this urge, they just can’t help themselves.” Then there were the wives who had to put up with their famous husbands’ philandering. “Everyone was having boyfriends and girlfriends,” says Vriesendorp, “but it was easier for men because they didn’t have kids. They didn’t have to go home and have no sleep for the night.”She cites having children and the cost of childcare as the reasons many women end up being sidelined. “Having kids totally limited my involvement in OMA,” she says. “It’s so tiring, being up all night, and having no time to do anything.” It is perhaps no coincidence that many of the world’s prominent women architects – Zaha Hadid,Liz Diller, Kazuyo Sejima – didn’t have children. According to aWomen in Architecture surveyconducted by the Architects’ Journal, more than 90% of female architects in the UK believe motherhood hinders their careers. More than half of the respondents said they had experienced sexual discrimination, whileanother surveyfound that women occupy only 10% of the highest-ranking jobs at the world’s leading architecture firms. There’s still a very long way to go before architecture reaches anything like equality. The lack of repercussions after the fleeting online publication ofa “Shitty Men in Architecture” list, detailing alleged incidents of bullying and sexual abuse by a large number of prominent male architects, shows just how tightly men retain their grip on the profession.As Vriesendorpput it in a recent interview: “What do they say? Behind every successful man is a surprised woman. Or now is it behind every successful woman is an angry man?”Denise Scott Brown’s Soane medal lecture is at the Sainsbury Wing, National Gallery, London, on 17 OctoberTopicsArchitectureWomenGenderDesignSir John Soane's MuseumAwards and prizesfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/16/the-scandal-of-architecture-invisible-women-denise-scott-brown,Oliver Wainwright,"

The just-released news that Meghan was pregnant appeared to create an atmosphere of forgiveness.No matter the sunburn, or the sore feet, or the rapidly dwindling phone batteries, no matter that rumour that spread after about an hour of waiting – that the royals were using up their precious public time in conversation with people at the front of their walkabout – they stuck it out.FacebookTwitterPinterestPrince Harry and Meghan arrive at the Sydney Opera House.People were there on their lunch break, because the weather was good, because their office or apartment was nearby.

Or because they were English and they felt the pull of some deeply submerged form of duty and kinship even on this far side of the commonwealth.And, finally, there was a small segment who were there because they really, truly, LOVE the royals.FacebookTwitterPinterestPrince Harry and Meghan meet Dafney Dunne, 97.

"o mark the centenary of the first world war’s end,Peter Jacksonhas created a visually staggering thought experiment; an immersive deep-dive into what it was like for ordinary British soldiers onthe western front. This he has done using state-of-the-art digital technology to restore flickery old black-and-white archive footage of the servicemen’s life in training and in the trenches. He has colourised it, sharpened it, put it in 3D and, as well as using diaries and letters for narrative voiceover, he has used lip-readers to help dub in what the men are actually saying.The effect is electrifying. The soldiers are returned to an eerie, hyperreal kind of life in front of our eyes, like ghosts or figures summoned up in a seance. The faces are unforgettable.Watching this, I understood how the world wars of the 20th century are said to have inspired surrealism. Thirty or so years ago, there was a debate in film circles about the sacrilege of colourising classic black-and-white movies. This is different. The colourisation effect is artificial, as is 3D (as is monochrome, too, of course), and the painterly approximation of reality presents a challenge to what you consider “real” on film. After a few minutes, I realised that force of cultural habit was causing me to doubt what I was seeing, because colour means modern. The colourisation, and everything else, is a kind of alienation shock tactic as well as a means of enfolding you in the experience. It is an indirect way of reminding you that this really did happen to people like you and me.They Shall Not Grow Old is arguably limited in scope: it is just about the western front and there is nothing about the German point of view, or about the war elsewhere: say, the Dardanelles. Yet this is because Jackson was working from specific archives – the BBC and Imperial War Museum – and spreading the net more widely might have meant a loss of focus and intensity. As it is, the focus and intensity are overwhelming.This is a film to fill you with an intensified version of all the old feelings: mostly rage at the incompetence and cruelty of a governing class that put these soldiers through hell in their mechanisation and normalisation of war. In Russia, the grotesque slaughter was a very important cause of the revolutions of 1917. Not in Britain.The title is taken from Laurence Binyon’s pious and patriotic poemFor the Fallen, although The Old Lie,from Wilfred Owen, might have been better. Certainly a better approximation of the tough, savvy spirit of Owen’s presentation comes over the closing credits, when the song Mademoiselle from Armentières is performed in its brutally cynical entirety.The details are harrowing, as is the political incorrectness of what the soldiers recall: some express their candid enjoyment of the war, others their utter desensitisation to what they experienced. When the end came, many felt only disappointment and anticlimax: “It was like being made redundant.” And in the war itself, there is nauseous acceptance of horror. You could die simply by stumbling off the duckboards and sinking into the mud. There were the fat rats (“and you knew how they got fat”), the trench foot, the lice. This film also shows you something no Hollywood production ever would: the latrines – a trench over which men would have to squat, sitting precariously on a pole, some inevitably falling in.It is possible that, if and when the technology used in it becomes commonplace, They Shall Not Grow Old may not be considered to have contributed much to what we already understand about the first world war. Maybe. Trench warfare and its horrors have arguably become a subject for reflex piety, while soldiers’ experiences in the second world war, or other wars, are somehow not considered poignant in the same way. But as an act of popular history, They Shall Not Grow Old is outstanding.TopicsLondon film festival 2018London film festivalPeter JacksonFirst world warFestivalsreviewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content",http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/16/they-shall-not-grow-old-review-first-world-war-peter-jackson,Peter Bradshaw,"

"ntil now, every US president I have known has considered [the UK’s] relevance to America to be enhanced by our membership of theEuropean Union. Yet very soon – on our current course – we will no longer be able to argue from within the EU for Anglo-American beliefs in free trade, open markets and strong defence. Our friends, the Americans, are hard-headed about power. It is romantic folly to think otherwise. Be in no doubt – if the UK can no longer serve America’s interests in Europe, she will look elsewhere for someone who can.Our value – as an ally of America – will decline. No “ifs”, no “buts”: we will be less relevant. No one should be bedazzled by folksy talk of our “special relationship”: it is becoming less “special” year by year.For centuries, our state schemed and plotted to prevent all Europe uniting against us. Now, we have chosen to turn our back on allEurope. A long line of former statesmen will be turning in their graves.We are told our future aim is to be “Global Britain”: that is certainly the right policy, but it is hardly new. It has been the reality for 300 years.May must produce new 'concrete proposals' if she wants breakthrough in Brexit talks, EU says - Politics liveRead moreWhat is new is that much of the world will now perceive Britain to be a middle-sized, middle-ranking nation that is no longer super-charged by its alliances. Suddenly, the world will be a little chillier.If the art of negotiation is to obtain what you seek, then the intention must be to give a little to (hopefully) gain a lot more.I cannot know how the government has conducted negotiations in private with the European Union: very possibly they have met the tenets I have set out. But, even if they have (and not all the signs are good), belligerent noises-off – on a daily basis – have built up ill will, and made the prime minister’s task even more difficult.We know the post-Brexit world will be very different from now. It cannot be otherwise, because no form ofBrexitwill remotely match up to the promises made by the leave campaign in the referendum: they were vote-gathering fantasies, not serious politics.I have no constituency vote clouding my view of Brexit. I have no ambition driving my support for it. I have no party whips demanding loyalty before conscience. I have made no false promises about Brexit that I must pretend can still be honoured, even though – in my heart – I know they cannot. I am free to say absolutely and precisely what I believe about Brexit. And it is this:I understand the motives of those who voted to leave the European Union: it can – as I well know – be very frustrating. Nonetheless, after weighing its frustrations and opportunities, there is no doubt in my own mind that our decision is a colossal misjudgment that will diminish both the UK and the EU. It will damage our national and personal wealth, and may seriously hamper our future security. It may even, over time, break up our United Kingdom. It will most definitely limit the prospects of our young.And – once this becomes clear – I believe those who promised what will never be delivered will have much to answer for. They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer. That will never be forgotten – nor forgiven.Our domestic focus is on the impact leaving Europe will have on the UK. That is quite natural, but, to the world at large, the bigger question is how the EU itself will be affected. The answer is – badly. Without the UK the balance of the EU changes. The free market majority may be at risk: protectionists will be encouraged and, perhaps, empowered.The UK will no longer be a buffer between the Franco-German steamroller and smaller nations. Germany will be more isolated, and friction may grow. “So what?” committed Brexiteers say. “We won’t be members: it’s Europe’s problem.” But that ignores reality. How can it not be our problem, too?Whether we are “in” or “out” the EU is in our neighbourhood; it is our predominant economic partner and our wellbeing is inexorably linked to their own wellbeing. In the hot heat of debate it should not be forgotten that we ignore the EU, disdain it, or stand aside from it, at our own risk.None of the mainstream political parties is in a healthy condition. Both the Conservatives and Labour face pressure from fringe opinion within their own membership.My fear is that the extremes of right and left will widen divisions and refuse to compromise, whereas more moderate opinion will often seek common ground. The risk of intransigence – “my way or no way” – is that the mainstream parties will be dragged further right and further left.Our nation should not tolerate the unreasoning antipathy of the extremes – to the EU, to foreigners or to minority groups. Such antipathy is repellent, and diminishes us as a nation. Softer, more reasonable voices should not be drowned out by the raucous din of the loudest.I freely confess to a taste for compromise. Politics is real life. It isn’t warfare. It isn’t a popularity contest. It’s about people.
